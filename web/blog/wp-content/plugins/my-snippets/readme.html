<h1>A guide to the My Snippets plugin</h1>

<p class="first">The <em>My Snippets</em> plugin displays custom snippets in the widget area of your choosing on a post-by-post basis. It allows you to easily display contextual content.</p>

<p class="second">While the plugin is both simple and powerful, it'll never replace such plugins as <em>Widget Logic</em> and <em>Widget Context</em>, nor is that the plan. What it does is allow you to add custom widget content from the <em>Write Post/Page</em> screen without having to go to your <em>Widgets</em> screen in the admin.</p>

<h2 id="install">How to install the plugin</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Uzip the <code>my-snippets.zip</code> folder.</li>
	<li>Upload the <code>my-snippets</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>
	<li>In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>
	<li>Activate <em>My Snippets</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to">How to use the plugin</h2>

<p><em>My Snippets</em> should be extremely simple to use for anyone that's ever written a post and used widgets.</p>

<p>The first step in using the plugin is going to your <em>Widgets</em> screen in your WordPress admin.  You should have a new widget called <em>Snippet</em>.  Add this widget to any widget area your theme provides.  Your custom snippets will display in that widget area once you've added some.</p>

<p>Now, you need some snippets!</p>

<p>When writing a post or page in the WordPress admin, you'll get a new meta box labeled <em>Snippet post settings</em>.  In this box, you can create a custom snippet title and add your snippet.  Once you've saved the post/page, your custom snippet will appear on that post/page on the site.</p>

<h2 id="plugin-support">Plugin support</h2>

<p>I run a WordPress community called <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a>, which is where I fully support all of my WordPress projects, including plugins.  You can sign up for an account to get plugin support for a small yearly fee ($25 <acronym title="United States Dollars">USD</acronym> at the time of writing).</p>

<p>I know.  I know.  You might not want to pay for support, but just consider it a donation to the project.  To continue making cool, <acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>-licensed plugins and having the time to support them, I must pay the bills.</p>
