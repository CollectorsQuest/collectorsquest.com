Allows you to add custom widget content on a post-by-post (or page) basis from the post editor screen.

== Description ==

The My Snippets plugin displays custom snippets in the widget area of your choosing on a post-by-post basis. It allows you to easily display contextual content.

While the plugin is both simple and powerful, it'll never replace such plugins as Widget Logic and Widget Context nor is that the plan. What it does is allow you to add custom widget content from the Write Post/Page screen without having to go to your Widgets screen in the admin.

**Features:**

* Post-by-post (or page) widget content that you control.
* Extra widget for use on your site.
* Easy-to-use snippets settings box on the post/page editor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `my-snippets` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

More detailed instructions are included in the plugin's `readme.html` file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

I love plugins like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-context" title="Widget Context WordPress plugin">Widget Context</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-logic" title="Widget Logic WordPress plugin">Widget Logic</a>, which allow you to add contextual widgets.  But, the thing that those plugins don't do is give you a way to add widget content without visiting the *Widgets* admin in WordPress.

I wanted a way to add a widget on a per-post basis when writing the post itself, so this plugin was born.

No, it's not a replacement of the aforementioned plugins but, rather, a complimentary plugin.

= How do I use it? =

Most things should be fairly straightforward, but I've included an in-depth guide in the plugin download.  It's a file called `readme.html`.  

You'll want to look over that.
