For those of you in-the-know, Joyce, and this album, need no introduction. For the rest of you, welcome to her world... Who is the mysterious Joyce? She\'s Joyce Drake. Why the fuss about the album? In the world of bad record covers and bizarre outsider/real people discs, this has become a cult classic. Widely regarded as \"the world\'s worst album cover\", it\'s not surprising that its the most popular record on the bizarrerecords web site, and is the featured prominently as such in Nick DiFonzo’s book, \"The World\'s Worst Record Covers Ever!\". It consistently shows up on many \"top 100\" lists of strange and worst record covers; and newspaper, magazine and online articles, as well as blog posts, show up all over – many include creative and hilarious descriptions of Joyce – the woman, the music and the album (one of my favorites being the writebrainmanifestations site\'s faux transcript to Joyce\'s \"VH1 Behind The Music Special\" – you\'ll definitely want to check it out). Often compared with Dustin Hoffman\'s character of Dorothy Michaels in the movie, \"Tootsie\", Joyce\'s image can be found online superimposed on all kinds of things (sexy bodies, celebrities, etc.) and is featured on all kinds of merchandise, including (but not limited to) t-shirts, coffee mugs, and even (gulp!!) the \"Joyce Thong\"! And sometimes the tables are turned – others\' faces are superimposed on Joyce\'s body! Ahhh, the sweet smell of creativity... This album has stimulated great interest in Joyce, the person. Who is this \"Lady of Mystery\"? Some speculated she was a guy in drag (see the \"Tootsie\" comment above), others thought she was an incognito celebrity. And up until several months ago, when her whereabouts were finally discovered, there was a \"worldwide search\" to learn who Joyce really was (there was even talk of hiring a private investigator to locate her!). Turns out she\'s a \"real person\"; and sorry, guys, she\'s already taken - she\'s the wife of an Assembly Of God minister in Sealy, Texas. And what about the music? For many, this is inconsequential – but in case you\'re interested, it\'s pleasant contemporary Christian fare. For obvious reasons, the title alone to her tune \"I Get All Excited\" has already made it as a cult classic in outsider music circles. And for similar reasons, \"It\'s My Desire\" should someday run a close second. Anyway, I call this \"THE MONA LISA OF STRANGE RECORD COVERS\", because, like the Mona Lisa, her inscrutable look elicits all kinds of wild speculation as to what she\'s thinking (not to mention what they were thinking when they chose this picture for the cover!).
