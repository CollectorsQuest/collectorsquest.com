INSERT  IGNORE INTO `interview_question` (`id`, `collector_interview_id`, `question`, `answer`, `photo`) VALUES (1,1,'How many dinosaur items do you have and what got you started?','Too many to count!  I’d estimate I have several thousand.  I got started when I was a kid.  Like many kids, I loved dinosaurs and I tried to learn everything I could about them.  I enjoyed playing with dinosaur toys and reading dinosaur books.  One Christmas, my parents gave me a red plastic bucket that was custom painted with dinosaur figures and my name in bubble letters.  I started keeping all my dinosaur toys in the bucket, adding new toys to it whenever I got some. Eventually, I had so many that they wouldn’t fit in the bucket anymore.  The collection just kept growing from there!',NULL),(2,1,'What is your favorite dinosaur and why?','When I was a kid my favorite was Tyrannosaurus rex, but now I am fond of the long-necked sauropod dinosaurs.  I am particularly fascinated with Apatosaurus because of its long and complicated history in scientific and popular culture: originally called Brontosaurus and reconstructed with the wrong head, an image of Apatosaurus is often what comes to mind when people hear the word ‘dinosaur’.  I think it is interesting to see how images of Brontosaurus/Apatosaurus have changed over time as new scientific discoveries have changed the way we look at this enormous dinosaur.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(3,1,'We need to mention you were the first collector on CQ. What was it about your collection that you wanted to show off?','Thanks! I suppose that makes me a dinosaur in the CQ community!  I think that the evolution of dinosaur toys and collectibles over time illustrates a very important idea about paleontology and science in general: science is dynamic.  New discoveries are constantly being made that force us to revise our ideas about the world; I think that my collection of dinosaurs is a fun way to illustrate this.  I have always wanted to make my own website to show off my prehistoric collectibles, but every time I start one I never finish it.  When I came across CQ I thought it would be a great way to share my collection with others.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(4,1,'What is the best dinosaur exhibit you have seen? Where is it located? What made it excellent?  ','The best paleontology museum I have seen is the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta.  But I think the American Museum of Natural History in New York has the best dinosaur exhibit.  The AMNH is very well organized and has two dinosaur halls; one devoted to each of the major groups of dinosaurs.  The halls are full of exquisitely prepared and mounted specimens.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(5,1,'You teach kids about dinosaurs. Tell us about that.','I am a graduate student working on my PhD in geology with a focus in paleontology – I am fulfilling a lifelong dream that started with a bucket of dinosaur toys.  I want to encourage kids to follow their dreams and try to make science fun for them.  I think it is important for scientists to communicate with the public, especially with children.  Now that I have access to all kinds of cool rocks and fossils, I love to share them with kids.  I like to localize my talks and tell kids about the prehistory of where they live and what dinosaurs might have walked in their back yards.  \r\n',NULL),(6,2,'How many items do you have and what got you started?','I started my collection in 1986 when my aunt gave me a small snowglobe within an owl playing sax. It was the first and the only one for long time! but since I had the chance to buy them by myself I couldn\'t stop! Now I have 190 snowglobes, which are presents, souvenirs or chosen by me',NULL),(7,2,'Have you ever created your own snowglobe? Tell us about it. If not, what would you add to one?',' I never did my personal globe, but if I should do it I would create a little sparkling world!\r\n ',NULL),(8,2,'We see you have a nice Christmas collection. Do you make it an annual practice to buy one?','Yes. every year I buy a new one because it is a way to enlarge my collection and to fashion my house for Christmas. Snowglobe is to me a way to relax because they are little perfect worlds.',NULL),(9,2,'You have a lot of snowglobes from tourist places in Italy? How do you think they stand up to the rest of the world? ','I have lots of italian snowglobes because I have the possibility to travel in my country and it is very nice to me to look for the most original and the research becomes more interesting when I visit small towns and villages. I have international snowglobes too, my friends\' presents.',NULL),(10,2,' If you had to put one in a time capsule to represent your life, which one would you choose and why?  ',' In a time capsule I would put one of Nordstrom snowglobes because I love them and I think that they represent the sweetness, the goodness, the serenity that I would for me and for who I love.\r\n ',NULL);
