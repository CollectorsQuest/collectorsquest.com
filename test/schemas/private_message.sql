Thank you!<br /><br />\nI think the book was The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek - I never read it, but I have a book called The Shy Stegosaurus of Indian Creek, which I think is the sequel - you can see it here in my dinosaur books collection.<br /><br />\nThere have been a lot of dinosaur finds lately - did you see the dinosaur mummy special on the National Geographic channel the other day?

I really really appreciate you sending me all that stuff.  I was not expecting all 3 packs of Dinosaurs Attack cards!  And the Wacko saurs stickers are awesome - I never had any - but the artwork is exactly the same as the folder I had when I was a kid - I will have to look for it the next time I am at my parents\' house.  Most of my collection is still in my old bedroom at my parents\' house in New Jersey - I have some D.A. cards there, but not many - I never had a whole set.  I looked through the 4 packs I have here in Kansas that I bought at a collectible show, but none of them had the Ankylosaurus in them.  And I\'m pretty sure I don\'t have that sticker in NJ either - sorry - I would send it to you if I had it.  I can keep an eye out for it for you.  I go to antique shops/estate sales/auctions/yard sales often so I can look for stuff for you if there is anything you collect.<br /><br />\nI only have a couple Flintstones things, but I would like to get more - mainly the Marx toys from the 60s.<br /><br />\nThe movie clip was fun to make - I figures it was worth embarrassing myself to try and win $20,000 - didn\'t win anything tho - oh well.  I borrowed a camcorder from my friend and filmed the clips.  Then I uploaded them to my Mac with the cable that came with the camcorder and edited them in iMovie - its pretty easy to get the hang of.  Let me know if you have any other questions about it.<br /><br />\nThanks again for everything - and nice stamps! (I\'m sorry if I didn\'t provide enough postage)  Did you stock up on those in 1989?  John Gurche is my favorite paleoartist.

(Yes, blank stares and laughs are acceptable replies!)<br /><br />\nI collect dinosaurabilia, a term coined by collector Dean Hannotte in 1980 to describe all dinosaur (and other prehistoric animal)-related collectibles.  I collect anything related to prehistoric life except vertebrate fossils—those belong in museums.<br /><br />\nThe most common response I get is: “I was into dinosaurs too…when I was a kid.” Emphasis on the “when I was a kid.”<br /><br />\n3) As a collector, what is one thing you cannot live without? (Not the objects/items<br /><br />\nthemselves, but other things related to collecting, such as \'space\', \'acid free paper\',<br /><br />\n\'eBay\' etc.)<br /><br />\nThe internet.  Partially because of eBay, but also because it would be so difficult to do research and find out more information about dinosaur collectibles.  I already do live without space!<br /><br />\n4) What is the \'crown jewel\' of your collection? Please include a photo, a description<br /><br />\nof the collection, a description of the item, and an explanation of why it\'s the crown<br /><br />\njewel in your collection.<br /><br />\nIt’s hard to say.  I have a couple of unique items that might qualify – here is one of my favorites:  In 1997 James Gurney, the artist and author of the Dinotopia books, painted a set of dinosaur stamps for the US Post Office.  In conjunction with their release, the Dinosaur Society held a contest to design your own dinosaur stamp.  I entered the contest and didn’t hear back so I assumed I hadn’t won.  Then 2 years later I received a package in the mail with a Dinotopia logo on it.  There was a letter inside explaining that shortly after the contest ended, the Dinosaur Society went under and the contest entries were locked in a closet and lost for 2 years!  Finally they were found and I was one of the winners!  I got an autographed copy of Dinotopia, plus my drawing back.  I still have the whole package, the book, my drawing, and the letter on Dinotopia letterhead.<br /><br />\n5) What \'holy grail\' are you currently seeking for your collection? Please name/describe<br /><br />\nit, how you know of it, a description of the collection, a description of the item, and<br /><br />\nan explanation of why you need it in your collection.<br /><br />\nI am looking for any prehistoric animal toys made by the Italian company Chialu.  They are from the 1950s and are made of composition so they are extremely fragile and break easily.  I know about them because of the book Dinosaur Collectibles and some websites.  Collector Joe DeMarco has a nice collection of them.  An individual Chialu figure can sell for quite a lot on eBay and I just can’t afford them right now.  I need at least one in my collection because I am very interested in the history of dinosaur toys in America and how they influenced children’s ideas about dinosaurs over time.  It is interesting to look at the evolution of dinosaur toys to see how they changed as the result of new paleontological finds.  I don’t concentrate on completing one set of toys; I try to get some from every set.  The 1950s also seem to be an especially important time for dinosaurs in American pop culture.<br /><br />\n6) How many hours a week do you think you spend collecting?

I do consider myself obsessed because sometimes I make irrational statements like, “I’d rather have more room for my collection than a bed to sleep on.”  I am a hoarder; I am always reluctant to throw things out (but I am improving).  And I also consider myself a bit of a teacher.  I have used my toys in talks I have given to children about prehistory and dinosaurs—the toys help get kids engaged.<br /><br />\n9) How many times a year do you visit museums &amp;/or other public displays (shrines)<br /><br />\ndedicated to your area of collecting?<br /><br />\nThere really are no such places for dinosaur collectibles.  The closest things are natural history museums.  Any time I travel I try to go to local museums.<br /><br />\n10) We\'ve all heard that eBay killed the mom &amp; pop antiques store/mall... Do you agree?<br /><br />\nDisagree? And please state your reasoning.<br /><br />\nI actually started using eBay before I started going to antique stores so I’m not sure.  But eBay has to have had some impact on them – people are less reluctant to part with things because they don’t know if they have a rare, valuable item…but its not just eBay, its Antiques Roadshow too!<br /><br />\n11) We all have our usual collector haunts online (websites, communities, blogs etc.),<br /><br />\nplaces we regularly read &amp;/or \'talk\' at.

I am always a collector first.<br /><br />\n14) If you sell as well as collect, please describe your criteria for selling vs.<br /><br />\nkeeping.

If you were stranded on a deserted<br /><br />\nisland, would you selfishly want your items with you, or would you prefer they were<br /><br />\nsafely protected back at home?

For<br /><br />\nexample, you\'d like it all safe at home except for three GI Joes to play with; or you\'d<br /><br />\ntake it all with you, except for one rare item which should remain protected elsewhere.<br /><br />\nI would prefer that my items were protected somewhere safe.<br /><br />\n16) The rumor is that we \'can\'t take it with us\'... I know, I know; that\'s not my version<br /><br />\nof heaven either. :sigh: But, have you made preparations for the \'here after\' and made<br /><br />\nplans for your collection which will remain here after you\'ve gone? Please explain.<br /><br />\nI have not made preparations, but I have told my wife I would prefer that they went to a museum so other people can enjoy them and learn from them.  But my wife would rather sell them all!<br /><br />\n17) Collectors are often called \'crazy\' or otherwise told, \"You should be<br /><br />\ninstitutionalized,\" but let\'s stick to the objects themselves...<br /><br />\nHave you ever had a public display of your collection? (Yard/garage sales do not count!<br /><br />\nlol) If \'yes\', please give details such as what the collection is, when &amp; where it was<br /><br />\nshown, and who initiated the show (you or the institution/space).<br /><br />\nNo, but I am currently communicating with the Toy and Miniature Museum in Kansas City about a possible dinosaur toy exhibit in the future.  I contacted them and am doing my best to sell them on the idea!<br /><br />\n18) Related to the above, would you ever consider leaving your collection(s) to a museum<br /><br />\nor other institution? Why or why not?<br /><br />\nI would only donate them to a museum if I died.  If I had my own museum then there would be no problem.  Its funny – I’ve invested so much of myself in my collection that having ownership of the items is one of the most important things.  That’s why I don’t mind lending them to a museum – then they are still mine!<br /><br />\n19) Did you ever get an item for your collection so cheaply that you felt like a thief?<br /><br />\nEver stumble into such a great find that your fingers shook when you picked it up? Please<br /><br />\ninclude a photo, a description of the item, and your story of such a find.<br /><br />\nThe J.H. Miller prehistoric toys from the 1950s are fairly rare toys.  This is because they are made of injection molded hollow plastic and break very easily.  The toys were made in 2 sizes: large and small.  The small ones are the hardest ones to find and even with damage will sell for over $100 each on eBay.  I went to an estate sale in Lawrence, KS and found a box labeled ‘boys toys $10’ that contained 3 of the small Miller toys.  They each had a little damage, but these are items I thought I would never have in my collection.  I think I did start shaking.  I had the cashier set them aside for me so I could keep looking through the house (there was more dinosaur stuff!).  But I kept thinking – what if somebody sees them and takes them or offers more for them??  So I went back to the cashier and paid for them and took them to my truck using the excuse I had to get a flashlight so I could look at things in the basement.  Then I went back to the house to keep looking.  There are pictures of these in my dinosaur toy collection on CQ.<br /><br />\n20) Do you have collecting \'bibles\'? (Price guides, reference books, magazines etc.) If<br /><br />\nso, please list your favorite three -- with a line about the importance/favor of each. If<br /><br />\nnot, why not?<br /><br />\nThere are really only 2:<br /><br />\nDinosaur Collectibles by Dana Cain and mike Fredericks, 1999.  This is a great resource with information and a price guide.  The prices are not all accurate anymore, but relative to each other they can let you know the rarity of an item.<br /><br />\nThe Dinosaur Scrapbook by Don Glut, 1980.  Not a price guide, but full of information about the history of dinosaur collectibles.<br /><br />\n21) For those that live with others, do other members of your household collect? If<br /><br />\n\'yes\', what do they collect? And does having multiple collectors in one home cause<br /><br />\nconflicts? If \'no\', are they supportive (enablers) or do they mock your collecting<br /><br />\nhabits?<br /><br />\nMy wife grew up collecting X-Men comic books and now she collects teacups and those Wade figures that come in boxes of tea.  She would not consider herself a collector and she discourages me from adding to my collection.  Although I have trained her pretty good at spotting dinosaur items at sales.  She grew up in a house with a father who is a collector and it turned her off to it.  Yet, her sister married a collector and she married a collector!<br /><br />\n22) What is the most \'over the top\' item in your collection? (\'Over the top\' could be an<br /><br />\nitem you paid the most for, is the most mocked by others, an item you went to great<br /><br />\nlengths to get, was once greatly desired by you but now seems silly, or, somehow, is<br /><br />\notherwise outrageous or has an outrageous story behind it.) Please include a photo, a<br /><br />\ndescription of the collection, a description of the item, and an explanation of why it\'s<br /><br />\n\'over the top\'.<br /><br />\nThe most over the top, silliest, mocked item in my collection is a flocked (covered in fuzz), hollow, plastic dinosaur toy about 8 inches long.  It is in sad condition with some missing flocking and it is missing an eye.  My wife and I used to live in a small town in Kansas and we used to go to garage sales and auctions there all the time.  But I never found any dinosaur toys at any of the sales we went to.  Then, one day at an auction preview I saw this old little dinosaur toy.  I have never seen anything like it before and it has no manufacturer’s mark on it.  The other toys at the auction ranged from the 1960s to the 1980s so I couldn’t even make a good guess about how old it was.  But I had to have it!  Well before the auction started it started to pour…and this was an outdoor auction.  We didn’t know if the auction would be cancelled, but we waited in the car to see if the rain would let up.  But it just kept pouring!  I went to find out what was going to happen – and the auction was going on!  The dinosaur hadn’t been sold yet so I waited patiently in the pouring rain – for an hour – until they got to the table with the dinosaur – it was soaked!  But I got it for $1!  I took it home and dried it off with my wife’s hair drier.  It now has a place of honor in my small curio cabinet.  My wife still claims that being wet caused it to grow mold and it smells and I should throw it out.  There is a picture of it in my dinosaur toy collection.',0,0,0,0,0,0,'2008-04-18 23:26:16'),(53,'210b0bf9a0a63b4ba30031032d11b444',12,150,'RE: NYC','Afternoon!<br /><br />\nThe CQ-Powers-That-Be decided not to do anything with NYCC this year besides send me to write about it.
