    description: 'I spent an hour at an auction in the pouring rain to get this guy for $1. I''ve never seen this dinosaur toy before. Its hollow plastic covered with fuzz, which my father told me is called flocking. There are no markings on it. Based on the ages of the other toys at the auction, this one is probably from between the 1960s and the 1980s - well that narrows it down!'

Now these next sentences will make no sense unless you collect Marx dinosaur toys...They are apparently recasts from the Marx revised mold group. There have been a bunch of playsets that used the old Marx molds, but I have really never seen the revised mold reused except in the SDC sets. These appear to be cheaply made because the Tyrannosaurus and Ankylosaurus have weird bulges on them as if the plastic was not given enough time to cool before being removed from the mold. The dark green plastic definitely looks like the SDC set I have. Can anyone help me figure out what set these guys are from??'

It is an egg that opens up and you pull out the neck, tail, and legs of a dinosaur and close the egg to make its body. The cool thing is in the 1980s there was a series of Masters of the Universe toys called Meteorbs and of course I had the one that was a dinosaur. It was purple and called Dinosorb I think. I still have it at my parents house - and this yellow toy looks like it is made from the same mold. Its exactly the same except for the little ring you can put a string through at the base of its neck.'

These are not pages from the book - I''m not sure exactly what they are, but I think they might be a set that was available as teaching aids? I could be totally wrong - when I hear Scholastic I think of the book clubs in school. This is cool because it is actually labeled Apatosaurus, not Brontosaurus in 1965!'

    description: 'Here it is, folks – the one, the only - MEGA-RARE, LEGENDARY "JOYCE" LP!!!! For those of you in-the-know, Joyce, and this album, need no introduction. For the rest of you, welcome to her world... Who is the mysterious Joyce? She''s Joyce Drake. Why the fuss about the album? In the world of bad record covers and bizarre outsider/real people discs, this has become a cult classic. Widely regarded as "the world''s worst album cover", it''s not surprising that its the most popular record on the bizarrerecords web site, and is the featured prominently as such in Nick DiFonzo’s book, "The World''s Worst Record Covers Ever!". It consistently shows up on many "top 100" lists of strange and worst record covers; and newspaper, magazine and online articles, as well as blog posts, show up all over – many include creative and hilarious descriptions of Joyce – the woman, the music and the album (one of my favorites being the writebrainmanifestations site''s faux transcript to Joyce''s "VH1 Behind The Music Special" – you''ll definitely want to check it out). Often compared with Dustin Hoffman''s character of Dorothy Michaels in the movie, "Tootsie", Joyce''s image can be found online superimposed on all kinds of things (sexy bodies, celebrities, etc.) and is featured on all kinds of merchandise, including (but not limited to) t-shirts, coffee mugs, and even (gulp!!) the "Joyce Thong"! And sometimes the tables are turned – others'' faces are superimposed on Joyce''s body! Ahhh, the sweet smell of creativity... This album has stimulated great interest in Joyce, the person. Who is this "Lady of Mystery"? Some speculated she was a guy in drag (see the "Tootsie" comment above), others thought she was an incognito celebrity. And up until several months ago, when her whereabouts were finally discovered, there was a "worldwide search" to learn who Joyce really was (there was even talk of hiring a private investigator to locate her!). Turns out she''s a "real person"; and sorry, guys, she''s already taken - she''s the wife of an Assembly Of God minister in Sealy, Texas. And what about the music? For many, this is inconsequential – but in case you''re interested, it''s pleasant contemporary Christian fare. For obvious reasons, the title alone to her tune "I Get All Excited" has already made it as a cult classic in outsider music circles. And for similar reasons, "It''s My Desire" should someday run a close second. Anyway, I call this "THE MONA LISA OF STRANGE RECORD COVERS", because, like the Mona Lisa, her inscrutable look elicits all kinds of wild speculation as to what she''s thinking (not to mention what they were thinking when they chose this picture for the cover!). And also like the Mona Lisa, this is EXCEEDINGLY RARE (other than my copy, it appears that less than ten copies are known to exist!)'

This album includes the hilarious "serious" liner notes from the original.'

    description: 'When I built my home I was cutting a beam for an expansion of the garage. I marked one end of the beam and it appeared that the line was not perpendicular to the edge. You check a square by putting on the other edge and striking a line. They crossed in the center, which told me the square was no longer square, which made it useless. In frustration I twisted it into a pretzel and slammed it down on the kitchen counter. It has remained there for 13 years as a testimonial to building one''s own home.'

They made a lot of people a lot of money and had 50 of these made as gifts for their largest investors. The woman I acquired it from left it covered for 20 years so her grandson wouldn''t see the nudity. I''ve let it patina to a natural shade.'

This was hand carved out of a solid block of "spalted" maple. The black lines you see are bacterial that have worked their wy into a maple log that had fallen on the forest floor and began to decompose. The artist soaks the wood in a bath of chemicals that kills the bacteria and stabilizes the wood. The wood is carved to be 1/8" thick over the whole piece. Amazing craftsmanship.'

They are much cheaper, are painted differently and do not have the JPIII logo on them. There are 12 different ones: Pteranodon, Brachiosaur, Stegosaurus, Dimetrodon, Velociraptor, Chasmosaurus, Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Pachycephalosaurus. So I suppose that makes the Baby Tyrannosaurus Rex, Compsognathus, Baby Stegosaurus, and Ankylasaurus the rarest of them all because they were only available in the Dino Packs and they are not being made today.'

The packs were sealed so you didn''t know which figures you would get when you bought them.'

I''m trying to figure out how old this is - its after Processed Plastic acquired Tim Mee, it has a UPC-A barcode on it, and it is missing the details of older figures (the horns on the Triceratops and the spikes on the Stegosaurus aren''t fully molded) - so I''m guessing its from the 80''s or 90''s? Can anyone help me out?'
