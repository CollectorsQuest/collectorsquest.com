    description: 'This copper token was issued in 1863 by Daniel Williams, a grocer who occupied the corner of Warren and Court Streets in what is today Cobble Hill Brooklyn. In 1863 merchants across the US issued their own copper coins to facilitate commerce. During the Civil War the US government cut back production of copper coins as copper was needed for the war effort.'

You check a square by putting on the other edge and striking a line. They crossed in the center, which told me the square was no longer square, which made it useless. In frustration I twisted it into a pretzel and slammed it down on the kitchen counter. It has remained there for 13 years as a testimonial to building one''s own home.'

    description: 'This is about as close to perpetual motion as you can get. Each stainless ring was cut from the center of the larger ring. An axle is attached at the balance point of each ring and each axle rides on its own track. Once the rings are set in motion they will rock back and forth for about 45 minutes with no assistance. Very soothing.'

The black lines you see are bacterial that have worked their wy into a maple log that had fallen on the forest floor and began to decompose. The artist soaks the wood in a bath of chemicals that kills the bacteria and stabilizes the wood. The wood is carved to be 1/8" thick over the whole piece. Amazing craftsmanship.'
