Now these next sentences will make no sense unless you collect Marx dinosaur toys...They are apparently recasts from the Marx revised mold group. There have been a bunch of playsets that used the old Marx molds, but I have really never seen the revised mold reused except in the SDC sets. These appear to be cheaply made because the Tyrannosaurus and Ankylosaurus have weird bulges on them as if the plastic was not given enough time to cool before being removed from the mold. The dark green plastic definitely looks like the SDC set I have. Can anyone help me figure out what set these guys are from??'

    description: 'I got this for 50 cents in a little vending machine at a rest stop in November 2007. It is an egg that opens up and you pull out the neck, tail, and legs of a dinosaur and close the egg to make its body. The cool thing is in the 1980s there was a series of Masters of the Universe toys called Meteorbs and of course I had the one that was a dinosaur. It was purple and called Dinosorb I think. I still have it at my parents house - and this yellow toy looks like it is made from the same mold. Its exactly the same except for the little ring you can put a string through at the base of its neck.'

The illustrator is George Solonevich - his style is very unique and I think its pretty cool. The prints all say 1965 Scholastic Magazines Inc. These are not pages from the book - I''m not sure exactly what they are, but I think they might be a set that was available as teaching aids? I could be totally wrong - when I hear Scholastic I think of the book clubs in school. This is cool because it is actually labeled Apatosaurus, not Brontosaurus in 1965!'

In the world of bad record covers and bizarre outsider/real people discs, this has become a cult classic. Widely regarded as "the world''s worst album cover", it''s not surprising that its the most popular record on the bizarrerecords web site, and is the featured prominently as such in Nick DiFonzo’s book, "The World''s Worst Record Covers Ever!". It consistently shows up on many "top 100" lists of strange and worst record covers; and newspaper, magazine and online articles, as well as blog posts, show up all over – many include creative and hilarious descriptions of Joyce – the woman, the music and the album (one of my favorites being the writebrainmanifestations site''s faux transcript to Joyce''s "VH1 Behind The Music Special" – you''ll definitely want to check it out). Often compared with Dustin Hoffman''s character of Dorothy Michaels in the movie, "Tootsie", Joyce''s image can be found online superimposed on all kinds of things (sexy bodies, celebrities, etc.) and is featured on all kinds of merchandise, including (but not limited to) t-shirts, coffee mugs, and even (gulp!!) the "Joyce Thong"! And sometimes the tables are turned – others'' faces are superimposed on Joyce''s body! Ahhh, the sweet smell of creativity... This album has stimulated great interest in Joyce, the person. Who is this "Lady of Mystery"? Some speculated she was a guy in drag (see the "Tootsie" comment above), others thought she was an incognito celebrity. And up until several months ago, when her whereabouts were finally discovered, there was a "worldwide search" to learn who Joyce really was (there was even talk of hiring a private investigator to locate her!). Turns out she''s a "real person"; and sorry, guys, she''s already taken - she''s the wife of an Assembly Of God minister in Sealy, Texas. And what about the music? For many, this is inconsequential – but in case you''re interested, it''s pleasant contemporary Christian fare. For obvious reasons, the title alone to her tune "I Get All Excited" has already made it as a cult classic in outsider music circles. And for similar reasons, "It''s My Desire" should someday run a close second. Anyway, I call this "THE MONA LISA OF STRANGE RECORD COVERS", because, like the Mona Lisa, her inscrutable look elicits all kinds of wild speculation as to what she''s thinking (not to mention what they were thinking when they chose this picture for the cover!). And also like the Mona Lisa, this is EXCEEDINGLY RARE (other than my copy, it appears that less than ten copies are known to exist!)'

The black lines you see are bacterial that have worked their wy into a maple log that had fallen on the forest floor and began to decompose.

    description: 'I bought these figures in a wholesale lot over Thanksgiving weekend 2008. They are made from the same molds as the Dino Packs figures! They are much cheaper, are painted differently and do not have the JPIII logo on them. There are 12 different ones: Pteranodon, Brachiosaur, Stegosaurus, Dimetrodon, Velociraptor, Chasmosaurus, Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Pachycephalosaurus. So I suppose that makes the Baby Tyrannosaurus Rex, Compsognathus, Baby Stegosaurus, and Ankylasaurus the rarest of them all because they were only available in the Dino Packs and they are not being made today.'

    description: 'These are two Dino Packs. They were sold in 2001 and I only ever saw them for sale at CVS. They were relatively expensive for what you got so that''s why I only bought 2. They had mini dinosaur figures and instructions for some kind of game to play with them. The figures are actually very nice and I think underrated. The packs were sealed so you didn''t know which figures you would get when you bought them.'

    description: "This Williams' machine from 1979 is pretty awesome! <br /><br />I obtained this from\r\n a local collector, and after months of tinkering, I just couldn't get \r\nthe sound to work. This version does NOT have the unique banana \r\nflippers, but traditional straight flippers instead. I bought this \r\nbecause the price was right and the graphics were incredible. All of the\r\n body graphics are still intact. <br /><br />I love this machine, and the time \r\ntravel theme (dinosaurs, astronauts, cavemen, knights, egyptians, and a \r\nton of other awesome details), but I'm out of space!\r\nMachine is in good condition. While the sound doesn't work, everything \r\nelse functions excellently &amp; turns on with no problem. Internal \r\nplastics look fine (awesome Egyptian bumpers!), though there's a \r\npossibility that I could have missed something, as I'm a relative \r\namateur. <br /><br />Known flaws include :<br />&nbsp;- Like most older machines, it needs to be cleaned inside and out.<br />- \r\nBackglass isn't perfect. Has scraping / peeling areas around edges, but \r\nit doesn't really interfere with the graphics.<br />- Wooden body has gouges, \r\nand two large holes drilled in the front (originally, to lock the coin \r\nbox down).\r\n<br /><br />So, it's time to part ways with this machine. Only 8,875 units were ever\r\n made, and it comes with a very high rating from the International \r\nPinball database!\r\nBecause of the size of the machine, it's local pickup ONLY, and I'm \r\nlocated within the Hudson Valley. You supply the tools (unbolt the legs \r\n&amp; upper portion), and I'll help you get it to the truck!\r\nMore pics available upon request!\r\nhttp://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=2568<br />"
