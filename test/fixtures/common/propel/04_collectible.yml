There have been a bunch of playsets that used the old Marx molds, but I have really never seen the revised mold reused except in the SDC sets. These appear to be cheaply made because the Tyrannosaurus and Ankylosaurus have weird bulges on them as if the plastic was not given enough time to cool before being removed from the mold. The dark green plastic definitely looks like the SDC set I have. Can anyone help me figure out what set these guys are from??'

Only the sides of the individual cards are showing, but you can tell from the packaging that there is 1 Night Velociraptor, 2 Jungle Spinosaurus, and 3 Arctic Tyrannosaurus. This is how all the cases were packed, making the Night raptor the rarest, the spino 2nd rarest, and the t-rex the most common.'

    description: 'I got this for 50 cents in a little vending machine at a rest stop in November 2007. It is an egg that opens up and you pull out the neck, tail, and legs of a dinosaur and close the egg to make its body. The cool thing is in the 1980s there was a series of Masters of the Universe toys called Meteorbs and of course I had the one that was a dinosaur. It was purple and called Dinosorb I think. I still have it at my parents house - and this yellow toy looks like it is made from the same mold. Its exactly the same except for the little ring you can put a string through at the base of its neck.'

The illustrator is George Solonevich - his style is very unique and I think its pretty cool. The prints all say 1965 Scholastic Magazines Inc. These are not pages from the book - I''m not sure exactly what they are, but I think they might be a set that was available as teaching aids? I could be totally wrong - when I hear Scholastic I think of the book clubs in school. This is cool because it is actually labeled Apatosaurus, not Brontosaurus in 1965!'

Guess that makes you one of the lucky few to see it and suffer permanent psychological damage as a result.'

    description: 'Here it is, folks – the one, the only - MEGA-RARE, LEGENDARY "JOYCE" LP!!!! For those of you in-the-know, Joyce, and this album, need no introduction. For the rest of you, welcome to her world... Who is the mysterious Joyce? She''s Joyce Drake. Why the fuss about the album? In the world of bad record covers and bizarre outsider/real people discs, this has become a cult classic. Widely regarded as "the world''s worst album cover", it''s not surprising that its the most popular record on the bizarrerecords web site, and is the featured prominently as such in Nick DiFonzo’s book, "The World''s Worst Record Covers Ever!". It consistently shows up on many "top 100" lists of strange and worst record covers; and newspaper, magazine and online articles, as well as blog posts, show up all over – many include creative and hilarious descriptions of Joyce – the woman, the music and the album (one of my favorites being the writebrainmanifestations site''s faux transcript to Joyce''s "VH1 Behind The Music Special" – you''ll definitely want to check it out). Often compared with Dustin Hoffman''s character of Dorothy Michaels in the movie, "Tootsie", Joyce''s image can be found online superimposed on all kinds of things (sexy bodies, celebrities, etc.) and is featured on all kinds of merchandise, including (but not limited to) t-shirts, coffee mugs, and even (gulp!!) the "Joyce Thong"! And sometimes the tables are turned – others'' faces are superimposed on Joyce''s body! Ahhh, the sweet smell of creativity... This album has stimulated great interest in Joyce, the person. Who is this "Lady of Mystery"? Some speculated she was a guy in drag (see the "Tootsie" comment above), others thought she was an incognito celebrity. And up until several months ago, when her whereabouts were finally discovered, there was a "worldwide search" to learn who Joyce really was (there was even talk of hiring a private investigator to locate her!). Turns out she''s a "real person"; and sorry, guys, she''s already taken - she''s the wife of an Assembly Of God minister in Sealy, Texas. And what about the music? For many, this is inconsequential – but in case you''re interested, it''s pleasant contemporary Christian fare. For obvious reasons, the title alone to her tune "I Get All Excited" has already made it as a cult classic in outsider music circles. And for similar reasons, "It''s My Desire" should someday run a close second. Anyway, I call this "THE MONA LISA OF STRANGE RECORD COVERS", because, like the Mona Lisa, her inscrutable look elicits all kinds of wild speculation as to what she''s thinking (not to mention what they were thinking when they chose this picture for the cover!). And also like the Mona Lisa, this is EXCEEDINGLY RARE (other than my copy, it appears that less than ten copies are known to exist!)'

The name came about from calling it Big Lincoln, then "Blincoln" and the "Blinky". We''re also huge Simpsons fans hence the three-eyed-fish "Blinky" on the dashboard.'

It is the only year that a Porsche Cabrio carried the name "Continental" as the US importer convinced Porsche that Americans only bought cars with names, not numbers. Ford took exception to the use of the "Continental" name and made them stop using it. In 1956 the car was called the 356-A. Ford won.'

You check a square by putting on the other edge and striking a line. They crossed in the center, which told me the square was no longer square, which made it useless. In frustration I twisted it into a pretzel and slammed it down on the kitchen counter. It has remained there for 13 years as a testimonial to building one''s own home.'

Complete with portly pig and prancing pup -- they are on the run! An estate find, this piece has a few paint flakes, a flea bite and a chip at the base (by the word ''Son'') We''ve taken many close-up photos, so please look at them. In our opinion these do not detract from this rare bit of nursery rhyme history, but rather add charm and authenticity to the piece. The winner will be proud to display this whimsical figurine. No marks for maker. Stands 6.25 inches tall. Base is 4 inches in diameter.'

Nearly 13 inches tall (to top of fixture), 5 inches side at the base, about 6 inches wide at the sides part of the floral arrangement. Yes, the lamps work! These lamps are primarily antique white (creme colored), with each lily having it''s center painted a warm yellow. Oval bases are painted metalic gold, as are several accents on the lilies. These are not the cold representations of cala lilies done in the 80''s -- these are warm & feminine. They are finished, front & back, so there is no ''bad side'' to hide! Conditions: Use, vintage item, but no chips, cracks or repairs. One of the lamps has this spot, which is not a chip. It appears to be a manufacturing flaw, an extra drop of paint, & we show it so you can see it. These are quite charming lamps, & very unique. They would be wonderful in homes with romantic or shabby n chic decors -- they are feminine, but not overly frilly.'

    description: 'A very large rubber squeaky toy, this pink elephant stands 9 inches tall, about 10 inches long. Marked The Sun Rubber Company, 1961, on both the back of the movable head and on the tummy. Though not marked with his name, this is Jolly Jumbo, #480. Jolly wears a hot pink circus-type headdress with details (lace or fine chain) in metallic paint, including along his forehead. Jolly is also roll-y -- he has wheels on the bottoms of his four feet. While Jolly Jumbo no longer squeaks (we can hear the squeaker rolling about inside), he rolls on his clear glass "marble" wheels just fine. A very unique and adorable find, that''s for sure! Conditions: Minimal signs of wear; his colors are bright and cheery. Again, he doesn''t squeak (don''t know if you can repair that? We didn''t want to decapitate him to find out, so we''ll leave that for the collector who has a clue.) No damages to plastic or rubber. Really a spiffy elephant awaiting a collector to show him off as he deserves.'

Made by De Luxe Game Corp, New York, the kit was considered an educational toy to teach young girls how to sew and make clothing - by making clothing for dolls. De Luxe Game Corp # 7131 - we are not certain of the year of this vintage item, dates range from the 30''s to 50''s. The box resembles a suitcase, with a latch & handle. This is for the box only - as collectors, we cannot bear to toss out boxes. Knowing we would scream in agony if someone threw away boxes for our goodies, we won''t be ressponsible for the screams of others! Conditions: Hinge is intact (so this box is in one piece!), the latch works, the metal handle is also intact & strong. Bottom of the box has grease pencil writing (only 10 characters). There are some broken corners on the box lid, along with scuffs & paper lifts where the cardboard shows through. One tear on the lid, near latch (shown in the photo.) The graphics are bright & charming. Please view the photos, and ask questions!'

On the back of the neck this doll is marked EIH © 1911. After some thorough research, we believe this to be one of the Horsman Can''t Break ''Em character dolls -- and also the first in the Gold Medal Baby series, its face having been created by Helen Fox Trowbridge. This head was sculpted in 1911 using her own one-year-old son, Mason Jr., as the model. This was the first time, the first in the series that Horsman called the Gold Medal Baby, that this mold was used. The doll measures 12 inches. We''ve taken lots of photos to show conditions, including the broken fingertips on the right hand, the wear on the left foot (likely from some child''s sucking, and the wear on the head. All the joints are flexible and move nicely. Overall, we are impressed with this old fragile doll''s beauty & charm -- and we hope you are too because he needs a loving home!'

Appears as if the top of her hat is missing a ''lid'' (perhaps she flipped it with all that flirting?) so you can see the top of her head. One tentacle has worn/threadbare spot. Green stitch on raised tentacle suggests she may have once held something. Otherwise, modest signs of wear/age. Measures approximately 5 inches tall.'
