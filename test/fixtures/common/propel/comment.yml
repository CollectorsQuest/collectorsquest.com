    body: "I am very proud of my home since I built it with my own hands. At the age of 42 (14 years ago) I embarked on the biggest project of my life. I bought an ugly house on a 1 acre lot that I loved and proceeded to throw most of it away. They took (9) 30-yard dumpsters out of here before I was through. I rebuilt the house over a 2.5 year period working on it 7 days a week until we moved in.\r\n\r\nI took a standard \"broad-front\" ranch and rearranged the floor plan, opened everything up and added a 2-story 1,300 square foot addition to it. The house had a walk-out lower level with a low ceiling. I tore out 1,600 square feet of concrete and lowered the lower level floor by almost 2 feet. My finished ceiling are now the standard 8-feet tall. This is important to me because I'm 6'5\" tall.\r\n\r\nEverything about the house is built around my size and our art collection. I knew where all the major pieces were going so the house is really designed around them. Thanks for asking."

    body: 'Who can forget Captain EO? No one!! Captain Eo was shown in Disney Theme parks during the 80''s until its curtain call in the 90''s. Indeed Michael Jackson is truly an icon that we will all miss! He transcended all generations,I being a child of the 80''s can''t remember my childhood without a glimpse of MJ. I am really very upset about his untimely demise and i will miss him immensely! ! MJ is truly an amazing guy!! A true genius and I will love him forever!! Manila like the rest of the globe miss him a lot! I know so since we were all there as well in the first day of THIS IS IT. The comic world was also touched by MJ''s genius. I am hoping that Disney will show Captain Eo again, the last time i visited HKDisneyland 07 ofcourse it was not there for me to relive but deep within me, i so wanted to relive my childhood and watch my darling MJ as Captain EO! Missing you heaps and will forver love you MJ!'

I once bought some 4" clogs, a bell bottomed jump suit with two seperate colored legs. Sometimes the evolution of fashion was painful but for the most part I would love to go back and live through it again.'
