    body: 'Definitely in Ka-Zar.  I''m not familiar with Kamandi or Warlord - but I will look into it.  I''m not a comic book guy.  My wife is a lifelong X-Men comic collector and she refrained from telling me about the Savage Land for years so I wouldn''t be encouraged to expand my dinosaur collection to cover comic books!  I was very excited to learn from your blog that Batman has a dinosaur in his Batcave - thanks for the tips!'

    body: 'Thanks!  I have 2 of these, both were purchased in antique shops in Pennsylvania.  This one appears to have the original paint - the other one had been painted over.  Neither of them have any markings on them at all.  I have seen these on ebay with the word Sinclair on the base of the tail - other than that these are exactly the same.  I thought maybe it was some kind of local thing in PA.  But when I got the book Dinosaur Collectibles I contacted Dean Walker and he told me that this was made by Sinclair in the 1930s.  Other than that I can''t find any information on them.  Do you think they were given away free at gas stations?  I wonder if they are from the 1933 World''s Fair.  I''ve seen Messmore and Damon souvenirs from the fair and know Sinclair had an exhibit, but I never saw Sinclair toy souvenirs from that fair - surely they would have wanted to compete with The World A Million Years Ago.  This figure must look pretty cool in chrome!'

    body: "I am very proud of my home since I built it with my own hands. At the age of 42 (14 years ago) I embarked on the biggest project of my life. I bought an ugly house on a 1 acre lot that I loved and proceeded to throw most of it away. They took (9) 30-yard dumpsters out of here before I was through. I rebuilt the house over a 2.5 year period working on it 7 days a week until we moved in.\r\n\r\nI took a standard \"broad-front\" ranch and rearranged the floor plan, opened everything up and added a 2-story 1,300 square foot addition to it. The house had a walk-out lower level with a low ceiling. I tore out 1,600 square feet of concrete and lowered the lower level floor by almost 2 feet. My finished ceiling are now the standard 8-feet tall. This is important to me because I'm 6'5\" tall.\r\n\r\nEverything about the house is built around my size and our art collection. I knew where all the major pieces were going so the house is really designed around them. Thanks for asking."

    body: 'Funny story about this toy...when my brother and I were kids we went to Dinosaur State Park in Connecticut and we were each allowed to buy 1 toy from the souvenir shop.  They had the ROM dinosaurs for sale there and I got the Chasmosaurus, my brother got this guy.  I always made fun of him for getting the stupid fish (I know it is not really a fish) instead of a cool dinosaur.  Eventually my brother cleaned out his room and gave me all his old dinosaur stuff because he knew I collected it.  So now I am glad he bought this figure!'

    body: 'Thanks Randy!  I am a big fan of your website.  Most of the smaller dinosaurs are Timmee knock offs, but they all say DFC on them.  The one small Triceratops figure looks like a flattened Tootsietoy Triceratops.  The playmat that came with the set is not the one shown on the box - it actually appears to be the playmat from the DFC Dragonriders of the Styx playset.  It makes me wonder if this is the playmat that actually came with this set or if the person I bought it from had both playsets and switched the mats.  The Sinclair recasts are the reason I don''t trust ebay auctions for Sinclair Worlds Fair dinosaurs unless they are MIP.  I am missing the rafts.'

    body: "Many years ago around the time when these first came out, I stayed home from school one day with a fever and watched TV while slipping in and out of consciousness. I remember seeing a commercial for these action figures and called around on the weekend to various toy stores. None heard of them and I began to wonder if I dreamt the whole thing. (Around the same time I dreamt of a sequel of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m glad these toys actually exist."

    body: "GREAT BOOK!!!! - -  Before there was EVER Jurassic Park - - Wells had nailed it!!!\r\nBack in the late 70's, I had an option on the book!  Wrote a screenplay and tried to sell the movie idea - unsucessfully, of course! Wonderfully written and very, very inventive! Hell of an idea - would have made a great movie!!!   THAT COVER - - I haven't seen it in years! - - brings back many fond memories. I may have to order it again online and read it!!!     "

    body: 'Young Dino Obsessor:  It is called the Omega T-Rex and it is from the Chaos Effect series of Jurassic Park toys.  The toys from the 2nd Jurassic Park movie, The Lost World, were very successful, so Kenner made a sequel to the toy line not based on any movie - the line was called Chaos Effect and the toys were supposed to be mutated dinosaurs made by combining the DNA of multiple species.  But for many of the toys, Kenner just took Lost World toys and repainted them and gave them new names.  The Omega Rex is a repaint of the Lost World Bull T. rex.  It originally came with a frightened looking man in a cage that it could swallow.  The slit is for removing the cage from the belly.'

    body: "Good morning Dinocollector-  Thank you for sharing images of your dinosaurs.  I am also a collector and have enjoyed seeing your collection.  I have a figure which I believe is an alva Brontosaurus, but am not certain.  There doesn't seem to be any markings, which may be typical.  It is also a different color than the one you have pictured.  Would it be OK if I send you an electronic image to get your opinion?\r\nThanks, Ginny"

    body: 'Tony - you are right. I too remember this album having King Kong and movie monsters at the back. The pic of Kong had him on top of the empire state building as  I recall.  I have got the above album and all the stickers are the same except there is no movie monster page at the back.  This album is from the 80''s. the one we are remembering is from 1977 and you can see the different album cover here - it shows a stegasaurous.  First sticker album I ever owned - wish I could find it somewhere http://www.dinofan.com/dfCollectibles/Set_Detail.aspx?IID=686'

    body: 'Greetings fellow JP collector! Regarding Kenner''s 1998 Chaos Effect line, you may find it interesting to know that, though the line was not based on one of the films (or even a concept for one), there was a cartoon television series that reached very early stages of pre-production (i.e. concept art based on the toys), as well as an entire second series of the toys which included not only numerous other repaints, but several new molds as well. These new molds included an Ankylosaurus, a mecha-suit similar to the one Lt. Ripley uses in Aliens, and another unidentified ''mixed'' dinosaur. '

    body: "Hi Dino collector,\r\nI have 9 of the SCG figurines. Do these figurines have much value. I have at least three figurines not shown in your illustrations on your page. I have a Pterasaur that looks different then yours, T-rex or Allosaurus, & a Diplodicus or some other long tailed long necked dinosaur.  Sorry, if any of the spellings are wrong. These were handed down to me from my grandfather. I have no idea where they were purchased, but I think they are in very good condition,  but my Dimetrodon has a broken tail at the tip. We Still have the end piece of the tail. \r\nThanks for your time, Tony S."

    body: 'Thanks Nathan! I have at least 2 Lost World thrashers packed away somewhere - I just haven''t had a chance to take a picture of them. I don''t think I have any of the capture gear tho. This picture isn''t my whole collection - its part of a lot that I bought from somebody selling their entire JP collection. '

    body: 'Who can forget Captain EO? No one!! Captain Eo was shown in Disney Theme parks during the 80''s until its curtain call in the 90''s. Indeed Michael Jackson is truly an icon that we will all miss! He transcended all generations,I being a child of the 80''s can''t remember my childhood without a glimpse of MJ. I am really very upset about his untimely demise and i will miss him immensely! ! MJ is truly an amazing guy!! A true genius and I will love him forever!! Manila like the rest of the globe miss him a lot! I know so since we were all there as well in the first day of THIS IS IT. The comic world was also touched by MJ''s genius. I am hoping that Disney will show Captain Eo again, the last time i visited HKDisneyland 07 ofcourse it was not there for me to relive but deep within me, i so wanted to relive my childhood and watch my darling MJ as Captain EO! Missing you heaps and will forver love you MJ!'

    body: 'I just bought a vintage Marx dino set and think there are some DFC dinos, but I''m not positive. The original Marx Brontosaur had circle indents on the bottom of it''s feet. Does anyone happen to have one of each handy? The set I got had 2 of these cavemen and they say DFC 1981 on them, and the Trachodon looks like a smaller version of a Marx. there''s also an unmarked Ankylosaur that is mud brown with no sheen, definitely not Marx or MPC. There''s also a smaller version of a Plateosaur in yellow with no sheen, smaller than an MPC, and the wrong shade. I know it''s a combination of at least 3 sets. I figured out the Marx and DFC, that was easy, but the other has me stumped. If someone responds and can leave a message, I''ll find a way to send the photos of these oddballs. I''m pretty familiar with the better known makers, but nobody''s perfect. If anyone can tell me how to anonomously post them somewhere, I''m willing to try it. I also have a Soldier Bear Deluxe Crusader Knights Castle Playset that I can''t seem to find anywhere. I tried all the bigger toy soldier collector sites and sent the pictures of that over a dozen times. No matches. You don''t spend hundreds of thousands to make that many molds for a 22 x 30 x13 high castle with inner and outer walls and not make them.... that''s just dumb... Help with either is greatly appreciated. '

    body: "It would appear from the blogs, that there were different versions released from 1965 onwards.\r\nOne had a picture of a stegosaurus on the front. At the bottom left of the cover was the figure of the jousting (Panini) knight.\r\nThis is/was the version with the section containing 'CREATURES OF MYTH, LEGEND AND FANTASY'.\r\nThe Abominable Snowman was the last sticker (No 360).\r\n\r\nCliff,the Prehistoric Animals stickers were released in 1965 and then again in 1977, also various companies had special sets commissioned to accompany promotions of their products ( Pepsi )for foreign markets.No idea of price and Ebay is of no use because they have lots of stickers for sale but really to make a set complete, you need a book as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is the answer to the posts. Depends on your age guys.\r\n"

    body: "I just turned fifty years old on the 5th of this month.\r\n\r\nI still have my green dinasaur bank, from back when I was just a kid.\r\n\r\nThe only thing wrong with it, Is my mother cut a slit by the coin opening.\r\n\r\nThe reason being is, I have a sister that was born in 1963 and I was born in 1961.\r\n\r\nMy dad and mom would buy their gas for the car on the west side of our little town of Marietta, Oh.\r\n\r\nMy sister and I both ended up with the same banks, And our mother put the same amount of change in each of our banks. My sister ended up with 5 pennies and I a nickle, besides some other change.\r\n\r\nOf course I cried and said my sister got more money then me!! mother said it was the same amount and I wouldn't hear of it.\r\n\r\nSo, when everyone was outside, I decided to get in my mother's purse, and took all her change from her billfold, including the silver house door key, and put all in my bank.\r\n\r\nWow, you talk about someone being madder then a wet hen, that was mom !!! She cut my bank, removed all the money and key, And I sure got the whipping of my life !!! I never ever done anything like that again in my life.\r\n\r\nI have showed my bank to my three children, And my four grandchildren, and have told them this same true story, Of course they have all got a big laugh about it.\r\n\r\nI laugh now, But I sure wasn't laughing back then !!! lol"

    body: "These Recordings have been released under various names of artists, but the same recordings!...\r\nI know three LP's released in Brazil this way. Their names: Tyler King &amp; The Twisteens (Dot label)/ George Torres &amp; The Twisters (SEECO label) and 'Twist em Vesperal' (Hi-Fi Variety-Albatroz label) ('Twist in Vesperal' means 'Twist in the Afternoon'). This last record is a miscellaneous and contains the name - I guess - of the true performers of these songs and includes RAY GARNET, BARRY FRANK, BILLY WADE, KEYNOTES, artists that recorded many many covers in their careers. This is Show Business...\r\nThank you.\r\nPlease, I like this record very much. Can you post it to me? May I get it? I will be very gratefully.   "

    body: 'Hello...I am looking for the PVC collectable of Cera...my daughter lost hers too...she carried it with her everywhere and was also crushed.  I believe it came as a promotional from JC Penny for the movie...I have looked everywhere for one and went door to door at our apartments and sifted through sandboxes.  My little girl is now 26 years old and married..I would dearly love to present her with Cera as a sentimental gift...nothing but that small PVC one will do!  Surely there is one out there someone will sell me?  Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Susan'

I remember scenes with a huge armoured convoy travelling across a wasteland. I remember it being quite gritty, or at least I thought so at that age. \r\nI'd really like to get a hold of it and see if it lives up to how I've pictured it in my memory. But I have no clue at all what it was called, and my Google skills are insufficient to find it.\r\nHelp much welcome!"

The mannequin is approximately 3 feet tall and dressed like the figure on the front of the coloring book above. It is in excellent condition and from what I understand was 1 of only 4 made between 1930 and 1950 . These were given to their regional managers to show how employees should dress . It is my understanding that it is now the only one left in existence . Could anyone assist me in pinning down a value for it , or direct me to a reputable person who could give me an accurate value?  Any information you have would be much appreciated .  Thank you"
