But imbedded stuff :ouch:  The built in media players are too 'old' and not accepted at too many sites -- and when you try to set your media to say RealPlayer, it doesn't believe you lol and tries to load the crud anyway.<br />\nI look forward to the bulk uploader for we (few) linux folks.

    body: "Wowza!  Some of those are stunning!<br />\nOK, back to your question... I think, based on talks on the phone, she's rather thinking along these lines:<br />\nNo nudity at all (unless 'classic art' or 'true art' by a 'real artist' which is going to be difficult to define no matter how you slice it as currently even museums are caving to cries of \"that's porn!\")<br />\nOr, nude works can be shown with those areas blacked/blocked out (which rather defeats/destroys the collection, IMO).<br />\nThough she did discuss a flag system where photos/images could be marked as 'offensive' by members -- which would then send a notice to you all, and you'd decide the object's merits.  If 'real art' then it would be flagged 'mature' or 'risque' and a member would have to click 'ok, I want to view it anyway' and then see it (without the blacked/boxed stuff).  But as that doesn't exist yet...<br />\nThis is why I'm not going to try my vintage postcards (even the humor ones), but rather wait for the adult site.

I only have Egg Stealers and Earth Shakers from Dinosaurs A Celebration - you can see it in my dinosaur comic book page here - I didn't know what the first issue was called so thank you for that - now I can look for it.<br />\nI was not familiar with Wacko-saurs until you told me - I looked them up and now that I see them I remember I had a folder in elementary school with the exact same artwork on it!  I think I still have the folder, but its in 2 pieces from use.<br />\nI didn't know there were comics of the Dinosaurs Attack cards - if you know of some web pages I can look at that would be great.  I often buy a comic book because there's a dinosaur on the cover - I love the artwork in comics - my wife gets mad at me because she used to collect X-Men comics and she thinks a comic's value is in the story, not the art.<br />\nI would really appreciate the Dinosaurs Attack wrapper/pack you offered - I would be happy to send a S.A.S.E. if you send me your address.  Thank you!<br />\nI think the book was The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek - I never read it, but I have a book called The Shy Stegosaurus of Indian Creek, which I think is the sequel - you can see it here in my dinosaur books collection.<br />\nThere have been a lot of dinosaur finds lately - did you see the dinosaur mummy special on the National Geographic channel the other day?  I missed it :( Hopefully they will replay it.<br />\nThanks again!<br />\n-Brian"

    body: "Hi John,<br />\nI received the envelope you sent back to me and I was pleasantly surprised with its contents!  I really really appreciate you sending me all that stuff.  I was not expecting all 3 packs of Dinosaurs Attack cards!  And the Wacko saurs stickers are awesome - I never had any - but the artwork is exactly the same as the folder I had when I was a kid - I will have to look for it the next time I am at my parents' house.  Most of my collection is still in my old bedroom at my parents' house in New Jersey - I have some D.A. cards there, but not many - I never had a whole set.  I looked through the 4 packs I have here in Kansas that I bought at a collectible show, but none of them had the Ankylosaurus in them.  And I'm pretty sure I don't have that sticker in NJ either - sorry - I would send it to you if I had it.  I can keep an eye out for it for you.  I go to antique shops/estate sales/auctions/yard sales often so I can look for stuff for you if there is anything you collect.<br />\nI only have a couple Flintstones things, but I would like to get more - mainly the Marx toys from the 60s.<br />\nThe movie clip was fun to make - I figures it was worth embarrassing myself to try and win $20,000 - didn't win anything tho - oh well.  I borrowed a camcorder from my friend and filmed the clips.  Then I uploaded them to my Mac with the cable that came with the camcorder and edited them in iMovie - its pretty easy to get the hang of.  Let me know if you have any other questions about it.<br />\nThanks again for everything - and nice stamps! (I'm sorry if I didn't provide enough postage)  Did you stock up on those in 1989?  John Gurche is my favorite paleoartist.  When the stamps came out I got a free t-shirt from the post office with pictures of the stamps on it - I'm not sure if I have a picture of it on this website or not.<br />\n-Brian"

So be sure to include:<br />\n* Your name as you wish to be made public<br />\n* One or two sentences regarding you and your collection. (Ex. Jane Doe is an avid<br />\ncollector of pens, bananas and is the mother of three.  She has no time to dust.)<br />\n* Your URL &amp;/or contact info<br />\n* If you have a profile at the CQ community, please provide that as well (this will be<br />\nincluded in addition to your own personal URL)<br />\nFeel free to pass this email along to collectors you know who would be interested.<br />\nSpeedy replies are appreciated!  (Late replies may still be used -- and interesting<br />\nreplies may lead to more interesting individual articles too.)<br />\nIf you have any questions, please ask :)<br />\nI thank you in advance,<br />\nDeanna Dahlsad<br />\nhttp://www.collectorsquest.com/<br />\nPlease answer any/all of the questions you feel comfortable replying to:<br />\n1)  What two characteristics or personal traits you feel are essential to being a<br />\ncollector?<br />\n2)  What do you collect -- and what is the most common reply you hear when you tell<br />\npeople about your collection?  (Yes, blank stares and laughs are acceptable replies!)<br />\n3)  As a collector, what is one thing you cannot live without?  (Not the objects/items<br />\nthemselves, but other things related to collecting, such as 'space', 'acid free paper',<br />\n'eBay' etc.)<br />\n4)  What is the 'crown jewel' of your collection?  Please include a photo, a description<br />\nof the collection, a description of the item, and an explanation of why it's the crown<br />\njewel in your collection.<br />\n5) What 'holy grail' are you currently seeking for your collection?  Please name/describe<br />\nit, how you know of it, a description of the collection, a description of the item, and<br />\nan explanation of why you need it in your collection.<br />\n6) How many hours a week do you think you spend collecting?  This includes, but is not<br />\nlimited to: shopping for items to purchase, admiring or talking about your collection,<br />\nblogging/writing about your collection, attending shows/events, researching, dusting.<br />\nFeel free to give breakdowns &amp;/or rationalizations if you'd like.<br />\n7) My belief is that '3 or more of something makes a collection'... What is your<br />\ndefinition of a collection?<br />\n8) Of the choices below, how do you classify yourself as a collector?<br />\na) 'just' a collector<br />\nb) a collector/historian<br />\nc) obsessed<br />\nd) addicted<br />\ne) a hoarder in general<br />\nf) other or combination (please list)<br />\nAnd now, state why!<br />\n9) How many times a year do you visit museums &amp;/or other public displays (shrines)<br />\ndedicated to your area of collecting?<br />\n10) We've all heard that eBay killed the mom &amp; pop antiques store/mall... Do you agree?<br />\nDisagree?  And please state your reasoning.<br />\n11) We all have our usual collector haunts online (websites, communities, blogs etc.),<br />\nplaces we regularly read &amp;/or 'talk' at.  Please list your top three -- include link/url<br />\nplease!<br />\n13) If you sell as well as collect, which came first, the selling or the collecting?<br />\n14) If you sell as well as collect, please describe your criteria for selling vs.<br />\nkeeping.  Is it difficult to make such decisions?<br />\n15) We all love our collections, but how much... If you were stranded on a deserted<br />\nisland, would you selfishly want your items with you, or would you prefer they were<br />\nsafely protected back at home?  Feel free to name specific items which may differ.  For<br />\nexample, you'd like it all safe at home except for three GI Joes to play with; or you'd<br />\ntake it all with you, except for one rare item which should remain protected elsewhere.<br />\n16) The rumor is that we 'can't take it with us'... I know, I know; that's not my version<br />\nof heaven either.  :sigh:  But, have you made preparations for the 'here after' and made<br />\nplans for your collection which will remain here after you've gone?  Please explain.<br />\n17) Collectors are often called 'crazy' or otherwise told, \"You should be<br />\ninstitutionalized,\" but let's stick to the objects themselves...<br />\nHave you ever had a public display of your collection?  (Yard/garage sales do not count!<br />\nlol)  If 'yes', please give details such as what the collection is, when &amp; where it was<br />\nshown, and who initiated the show (you or the institution/space).<br />\n18) Related to the above, would you ever consider leaving your collection(s) to a museum<br />\nor other institution?  Why or why not?<br />\n19) Did you ever get an item for your collection so cheaply that you felt like a thief?<br />\nEver stumble into such a great find that your fingers shook when you picked it up? Please<br />\ninclude a photo, a description of the item, and your story of such a find.<br />\n20) Do you have collecting 'bibles'? (Price guides, reference books, magazines etc.) If<br />\nso, please list your favorite three -- with a line about the importance/favor of each. If<br />\nnot, why not?<br />\n21) For those that live with others, do other members of your household collect? If<br />\n'yes', what do they collect?  And does having multiple collectors in one home cause<br />\nconflicts?  If 'no', are they supportive (enablers) or do they mock your collecting<br />\nhabits?<br />\n22) What is the most 'over the top' item in your collection?  ('Over the top' could be an<br />\nitem you paid the most for, is the most mocked by others, an item you went to great<br />\nlengths to get, was once greatly desired by you but now seems silly, or, somehow, is<br />\notherwise outrageous or has an outrageous story behind it.)  Please include a photo, a<br />\ndescription of the collection, a description of the item, and an explanation of why it's<br />\n'over the top'."

    body: "Hi - sorry it took me a while to get back to you.  When I was a kid I somehow missed the Monsters in My Pocket toys and I never ate at a Hardee's so I'm not actually sure thats what these figures are.  I am calling them that based on pictures and information I have found on the internet and ebay.  Can you tell from the pictures if they are Dinosaurs In my Pocket?  I can tell you that they have not been painted so they are the original colors.  I should also tell you that the orange Brontosaurus looks like it has been chewed on - there are some small puncture marks in it.  Let me know if you are still interested.  I would like to know about your other dinosaur figures too!  You can contact me at bfplatt@gmail.com.<br />\nThanks,<br />\nBrian"

    subject: 'RE: Questions for Collectors'
    body: "Hi Deanna,<br />\nI'm sorry it took me so long to reply - it is a busy time for me right now.  Here are my answers to your questions.  Thanks for asking!<br />\n-Brian<br />\n* Your name as you wish to be made public:<br />\nBrian a.k.a. Bri the Dino Guy a.k.a. dinocollector<br />\n* One or two sentences regarding you and your collection. (Ex. Jane Doe is an avid<br />\ncollector of pens, bananas and is the mother of three. She has no time to dust.).<br />\nBrian is a lifelong collector of dinosaurabilia—any item related to dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals.  He will soon be the father of one little boy who will be very distraught when he discovers his father’s collection of dinosaur toys and is forbidden from playing with them.<br />\n* Your URL &amp;/or contact info<br />\nPlease use CQ Profile<br />\n* If you have a profile at the CQ community, please provide that as well (this will be<br />\nincluded in addition to your own personal URL)<br />\nhttp://www.collectorsquest.com/collector/dinocollector.html<br />\nFeel free to pass this email along to collectors you know who would be interested.<br />\nSpeedy replies are appreciated! (Late replies may still be used -- and interesting<br />\nreplies may lead to more interesting individual articles too.)<br />\nIf you have any questions, please ask :)<br />\nI thank you in advance,<br />\nDeanna Dahlsad<br />\nhttp://www.collectorsquest.com/<br />\nPlease answer any/all of the questions you feel comfortable replying to:<br />\n1) What two characteristics or personal traits you feel are essential to being a<br />\ncollector?<br />\n1) Patience—you will eventually find the item you are searching for.<br />\n2) Persistence—don’t give up the hunt!<br />\n2) What do you collect -- and what is the most common reply you hear when you tell<br />\npeople about your collection? (Yes, blank stares and laughs are acceptable replies!)<br />\nI collect dinosaurabilia, a term coined by collector Dean Hannotte in 1980 to describe all dinosaur (and other prehistoric animal)-related collectibles.  I collect anything related to prehistoric life except vertebrate fossils—those belong in museums.<br />\nThe most common response I get is: “I was into dinosaurs too…when I was a kid.” Emphasis on the “when I was a kid.”<br />\n3) As a collector, what is one thing you cannot live without? (Not the objects/items<br />\nthemselves, but other things related to collecting, such as 'space', 'acid free paper',<br />\n'eBay' etc.)<br />\nThe internet.  Partially because of eBay, but also because it would be so difficult to do research and find out more information about dinosaur collectibles.  I already do live without space!<br />\n4) What is the 'crown jewel' of your collection? Please include a photo, a description<br />\nof the collection, a description of the item, and an explanation of why it's the crown<br />\njewel in your collection.<br />\nIt’s hard to say.  I have a couple of unique items that might qualify – here is one of my favorites:  In 1997 James Gurney, the artist and author of the Dinotopia books, painted a set of dinosaur stamps for the US Post Office.  In conjunction with their release, the Dinosaur Society held a contest to design your own dinosaur stamp.  I entered the contest and didn’t hear back so I assumed I hadn’t won.  Then 2 years later I received a package in the mail with a Dinotopia logo on it.  There was a letter inside explaining that shortly after the contest ended, the Dinosaur Society went under and the contest entries were locked in a closet and lost for 2 years!  Finally they were found and I was one of the winners!  I got an autographed copy of Dinotopia, plus my drawing back.  I still have the whole package, the book, my drawing, and the letter on Dinotopia letterhead.<br />\n5) What 'holy grail' are you currently seeking for your collection? Please name/describe<br />\nit, how you know of it, a description of the collection, a description of the item, and<br />\nan explanation of why you need it in your collection.<br />\nI am looking for any prehistoric animal toys made by the Italian company Chialu.  They are from the 1950s and are made of composition so they are extremely fragile and break easily.  I know about them because of the book Dinosaur Collectibles and some websites.  Collector Joe DeMarco has a nice collection of them.  An individual Chialu figure can sell for quite a lot on eBay and I just can’t afford them right now.  I need at least one in my collection because I am very interested in the history of dinosaur toys in America and how they influenced children’s ideas about dinosaurs over time.  It is interesting to look at the evolution of dinosaur toys to see how they changed as the result of new paleontological finds.  I don’t concentrate on completing one set of toys; I try to get some from every set.  The 1950s also seem to be an especially important time for dinosaurs in American pop culture.<br />\n6) How many hours a week do you think you spend collecting? This includes, but is not<br />\nlimited to: shopping for items to purchase, admiring or talking about your collection,<br />\nblogging/writing about your collection, attending shows/events, researching, dusting.<br />\nFeel free to give breakdowns &amp;/or rationalizations if you'd like.<br />\nIt differs by week; I’m not sure I could come up with a number – I’d rather not think about how much time I spend with my collection instead of getting work done!<br />\n7) My belief is that '3 or more of something makes a collection'... What is your<br />\ndefinition of a collection?<br />\nA group of items united by a common theme that were acquired by and are cared for by an organism.<br />\n8) Of the choices below, how do you classify yourself as a collector?<br />\na) 'just' a collector<br />\nb) a collector/historian<br />\nc) obsessed<br />\nd) addicted<br />\ne) a hoarder in general<br />\nf) other or combination (please list)<br />\nb, c, e, f.<br />\nAnd now, state why!<br />\nI explained the historical aspect in #5—I like to think I am helping to preserve a neat part of American childhood through time .  I do consider myself obsessed because sometimes I make irrational statements like, “I’d rather have more room for my collection than a bed to sleep on.”  I am a hoarder; I am always reluctant to throw things out (but I am improving).  And I also consider myself a bit of a teacher.  I have used my toys in talks I have given to children about prehistory and dinosaurs—the toys help get kids engaged.<br />\n9) How many times a year do you visit museums &amp;/or other public displays (shrines)<br />\ndedicated to your area of collecting?<br />\nThere really are no such places for dinosaur collectibles.  The closest things are natural history museums.  Any time I travel I try to go to local museums.<br />\n10) We've all heard that eBay killed the mom &amp; pop antiques store/mall... Do you agree?<br />\nDisagree? And please state your reasoning.<br />\nI actually started using eBay before I started going to antique stores so I’m not sure.  But eBay has to have had some impact on them – people are less reluctant to part with things because they don’t know if they have a rare, valuable item…but its not just eBay, its Antiques Roadshow too!<br />\n11) We all have our usual collector haunts online (websites, communities, blogs etc.),<br />\nplaces we regularly read &amp;/or 'talk' at. Please list your top three -- include link/url<br />\nplease!<br />\nThe best resources are :<br />\nThe Dinosaur Collector:<br />\nhttp://www.dinosaurcollector.150m.com/<br />\nThe Realm of Rubber Dinosaurs:<br />\nhttp://www.rubberdinosaurs.com/<br />\nand if I need to research something from the Jurassic Park franchise I go to:<br />\nwww.jptoys.com<br />\n13) If you sell as well as collect, which came first, the selling or the collecting?<br />\nI only sell things I have doubles of.  I am always a collector first.<br />\n14) If you sell as well as collect, please describe your criteria for selling vs.<br />\nkeeping. Is it difficult to make such decisions?<br />\nI only sell duplicates—I keep the items in best condition for myself.<br />\n15) We all love our collections, but how much... If you were stranded on a deserted<br />\nisland, would you selfishly want your items with you, or would you prefer they were<br />\nsafely protected back at home? Feel free to name specific items which may differ. For<br />\nexample, you'd like it all safe at home except for three GI Joes to play with; or you'd<br />\ntake it all with you, except for one rare item which should remain protected elsewhere.<br />\nI would prefer that my items were protected somewhere safe.<br />\n16) The rumor is that we 'can't take it with us'... I know, I know; that's not my version<br />\nof heaven either. :sigh: But, have you made preparations for the 'here after' and made<br />\nplans for your collection which will remain here after you've gone? Please explain.<br />\nI have not made preparations, but I have told my wife I would prefer that they went to a museum so other people can enjoy them and learn from them.  But my wife would rather sell them all!<br />\n17) Collectors are often called 'crazy' or otherwise told, \"You should be<br />\ninstitutionalized,\" but let's stick to the objects themselves...<br />\nHave you ever had a public display of your collection? (Yard/garage sales do not count!<br />\nlol) If 'yes', please give details such as what the collection is, when &amp; where it was<br />\nshown, and who initiated the show (you or the institution/space).<br />\nNo, but I am currently communicating with the Toy and Miniature Museum in Kansas City about a possible dinosaur toy exhibit in the future.  I contacted them and am doing my best to sell them on the idea!<br />\n18) Related to the above, would you ever consider leaving your collection(s) to a museum<br />\nor other institution? Why or why not?<br />\nI would only donate them to a museum if I died.  If I had my own museum then there would be no problem.  Its funny – I’ve invested so much of myself in my collection that having ownership of the items is one of the most important things.  That’s why I don’t mind lending them to a museum – then they are still mine!<br />\n19) Did you ever get an item for your collection so cheaply that you felt like a thief?<br />\nEver stumble into such a great find that your fingers shook when you picked it up? Please<br />\ninclude a photo, a description of the item, and your story of such a find.<br />\nThe J.H. Miller prehistoric toys from the 1950s are fairly rare toys.  This is because they are made of injection molded hollow plastic and break very easily.  The toys were made in 2 sizes: large and small.  The small ones are the hardest ones to find and even with damage will sell for over $100 each on eBay.  I went to an estate sale in Lawrence, KS and found a box labeled ‘boys toys $10’ that contained 3 of the small Miller toys.  They each had a little damage, but these are items I thought I would never have in my collection.  I think I did start shaking.  I had the cashier set them aside for me so I could keep looking through the house (there was more dinosaur stuff!).  But I kept thinking – what if somebody sees them and takes them or offers more for them??  So I went back to the cashier and paid for them and took them to my truck using the excuse I had to get a flashlight so I could look at things in the basement.  Then I went back to the house to keep looking.  There are pictures of these in my dinosaur toy collection on CQ.<br />\n20) Do you have collecting 'bibles'? (Price guides, reference books, magazines etc.) If<br />\nso, please list your favorite three -- with a line about the importance/favor of each. If<br />\nnot, why not?<br />\nThere are really only 2:<br />\nDinosaur Collectibles by Dana Cain and mike Fredericks, 1999.  This is a great resource with information and a price guide.  The prices are not all accurate anymore, but relative to each other they can let you know the rarity of an item.<br />\nThe Dinosaur Scrapbook by Don Glut, 1980.  Not a price guide, but full of information about the history of dinosaur collectibles.<br />\n21) For those that live with others, do other members of your household collect? If<br />\n'yes', what do they collect? And does having multiple collectors in one home cause<br />\nconflicts? If 'no', are they supportive (enablers) or do they mock your collecting<br />\nhabits?<br />\nMy wife grew up collecting X-Men comic books and now she collects teacups and those Wade figures that come in boxes of tea.  She would not consider herself a collector and she discourages me from adding to my collection.  Although I have trained her pretty good at spotting dinosaur items at sales.  She grew up in a house with a father who is a collector and it turned her off to it.  Yet, her sister married a collector and she married a collector!<br />\n22) What is the most 'over the top' item in your collection? ('Over the top' could be an<br />\nitem you paid the most for, is the most mocked by others, an item you went to great<br />\nlengths to get, was once greatly desired by you but now seems silly, or, somehow, is<br />\notherwise outrageous or has an outrageous story behind it.) Please include a photo, a<br />\ndescription of the collection, a description of the item, and an explanation of why it's<br />\n'over the top'.<br />\nThe most over the top, silliest, mocked item in my collection is a flocked (covered in fuzz), hollow, plastic dinosaur toy about 8 inches long.  It is in sad condition with some missing flocking and it is missing an eye.  My wife and I used to live in a small town in Kansas and we used to go to garage sales and auctions there all the time.  But I never found any dinosaur toys at any of the sales we went to.  Then, one day at an auction preview I saw this old little dinosaur toy.  I have never seen anything like it before and it has no manufacturer’s mark on it.  The other toys at the auction ranged from the 1960s to the 1980s so I couldn’t even make a good guess about how old it was.  But I had to have it!  Well before the auction started it started to pour…and this was an outdoor auction.  We didn’t know if the auction would be cancelled, but we waited in the car to see if the rain would let up.  But it just kept pouring!  I went to find out what was going to happen – and the auction was going on!  The dinosaur hadn’t been sold yet so I waited patiently in the pouring rain – for an hour – until they got to the table with the dinosaur – it was soaked!  But I got it for $1!  I took it home and dried it off with my wife’s hair drier.  It now has a place of honor in my small curio cabinet.  My wife still claims that being wet caused it to grow mold and it smells and I should throw it out.  There is a picture of it in my dinosaur toy collection."

Its also at my parents'' house, which is 1200 miles away from where I''m living now so I''m not able to get to it.  I''m surprised you can''t find one on ebay for $100 - I would think for that much you would be able to get one with the dino damage skin piece (mine is missing that).  I hope you are able to find one.  You could also try joining the forum at www.jptoys.com - you might be able to trade somebody for one there.'

    body: "Thanks for the kind words! My biggest problem is that I have NO display space, and also no space to keep everything in the packages, which is why I go through everything once a year and tear it all open.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI tend to see it all as potential art, and all of it as active inspiration. This kind of stuff inspired me to start sculpting my own toys. You can see some stuff here : http://resonantfish.com/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd other stuff here : http://resonantfish.bigcartel.com/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe scariest part is that these things don't even scrape the surface of what I've collected over the last 15 years. There are at least 20 waves of Heroclix that I haven't had the time to photo yet, and stacks of.... everything. I'm sometimes surprised that I've amassed to much, especially since I make barely over minimum wage, but I pick up a lot of illustration and writing jobs on the side too. I guess that's the cost of collecting sometimes - absolutely no free time. It's a really crazy balance to maintain, and lately, I've severely cut back just so I could have time to breathe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow do you balance life and collecting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAwesome to hear from a fellow collector!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollin"
