When I discovered antique shops and eBay I started hunting older dinosaur toys.  Its really cool to look at how images of dinosaurs have changed as a result of new paleontological findings.  I don''t just collect dinosaur toys - I collect anything relating to dinosaurs or prehistoric life.  This overlaps with many other categories of collecting: ephemera, books, movies, posters, advertising, comic books, post cards, clothing.  Dinosaurs are everywhere!'
