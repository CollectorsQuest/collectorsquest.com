I slept in and wasn''t planning on going to sales today, but my wife was looking through the ads and found one that advertised "large dinosaur collection."  Well, I was ready to go in a second!  But it was 10:30 and the sale started at 8.  Would there be anything left?  Well, there was - here is everything I bought - all for $20.'

    description: 'All regularly released miniature block figures from DC Direct & Diamond, plus a convention exclusive Green Lantern. All of the figures marked ''C3'' were produced prior to the main line, before Art Asylum had the rights to produce mini figures by themselves. As a result, each of these came with a Lego-like construction kit called C3, which were notorious for missing pieces. Most valuable is the Martian Manhunter piece, as an important member of the JLU never reproduced as a lone figure.'

The line died out when the rights to Marvel toys went to Hasbro, but as you can see here, they were might fine for what they were.'
