    question: 'How many dinosaur items do you have and what got you started?'
    answer: 'Too many to count!  I’d estimate I have several thousand.  I got started when I was a kid.  Like many kids, I loved dinosaurs and I tried to learn everything I could about them.  I enjoyed playing with dinosaur toys and reading dinosaur books.  One Christmas, my parents gave me a red plastic bucket that was custom painted with dinosaur figures and my name in bubble letters.  I started keeping all my dinosaur toys in the bucket, adding new toys to it whenever I got some. Eventually, I had so many that they wouldn’t fit in the bucket anymore.  The collection just kept growing from there!'

    question: 'What is your favorite dinosaur and why?'
    answer: "When I was a kid my favorite was Tyrannosaurus rex, but now I am fond of the long-necked sauropod dinosaurs.  I am particularly fascinated with Apatosaurus because of its long and complicated history in scientific and popular culture: originally called Brontosaurus and reconstructed with the wrong head, an image of Apatosaurus is often what comes to mind when people hear the word ‘dinosaur’.  I think it is interesting to see how images of Brontosaurus/Apatosaurus have changed over time as new scientific discoveries have changed the way we look at this enormous dinosaur.\r\n\r\n"

    question: 'We need to mention you were the first collector on CQ. What was it about your collection that you wanted to show off?'
    answer: "Thanks! I suppose that makes me a dinosaur in the CQ community!  I think that the evolution of dinosaur toys and collectibles over time illustrates a very important idea about paleontology and science in general: science is dynamic.  New discoveries are constantly being made that force us to revise our ideas about the world; I think that my collection of dinosaurs is a fun way to illustrate this.  I have always wanted to make my own website to show off my prehistoric collectibles, but every time I start one I never finish it.  When I came across CQ I thought it would be a great way to share my collection with others.\r\n\r\n"

    question: 'What is the best dinosaur exhibit you have seen? Where is it located? What made it excellent?  '
    answer: "The best paleontology museum I have seen is the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta.  But I think the American Museum of Natural History in New York has the best dinosaur exhibit.  The AMNH is very well organized and has two dinosaur halls; one devoted to each of the major groups of dinosaurs.  The halls are full of exquisitely prepared and mounted specimens.\r\n\r\n"

    question: 'You teach kids about dinosaurs. Tell us about that.'
    answer: "I am a graduate student working on my PhD in geology with a focus in paleontology – I am fulfilling a lifelong dream that started with a bucket of dinosaur toys.  I want to encourage kids to follow their dreams and try to make science fun for them.  I think it is important for scientists to communicate with the public, especially with children.  Now that I have access to all kinds of cool rocks and fossils, I love to share them with kids.  I like to localize my talks and tell kids about the prehistory of where they live and what dinosaurs might have walked in their back yards.  \r\n"

    answer: 'I started my collection in 1986 when my aunt gave me a small snowglobe within an owl playing sax.

    question: 'You have a lot of snowglobes from tourist places in Italy? How do you think they stand up to the rest of the world? '
    answer: 'I have lots of italian snowglobes because I have the possibility to travel in my country and it is very nice to me to look for the most original and the research becomes more interesting when I visit small towns and villages. I have international snowglobes too, my friends'' presents.'

    question: ' If you had to put one in a time capsule to represent your life, which one would you choose and why?  '
    answer: " In a time capsule I would put one of Nordstrom snowglobes because I love them and I think that they represent the sweetness, the goodness, the serenity that I would for me and for who I love.\r\n "
