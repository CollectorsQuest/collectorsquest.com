    description: 'My collection focuses on 19th and 20th century merchant tokens issued in Brooklyn, New York.  Most of these were issued by retail stores as promotional items.  However, the collection includes an array of other Brooklyn tokens including tokens issued by the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Brooklyn City Prison, Brooklyn mass transit organizations, and the YMCA.  The collection provides interesting and unusual snapshots of Brooklyn''s lost history.'
