    description: "<p>Made in the 2000s by NECA, six waves (or four figures / packs each) were produced before production stopped (with some figures repeated a few times) - but they encompass a huge array of characters. Box sets included Lock, Shock &amp; Barrel, Oogie's Lair, Jack's Snowmobile and Jack &amp; Sally on the spiral hill. Comicon exclusives include a Pirate Jack and a Vampire Jack. The collection here is woefully incomplete, but mostly here. Accessories pictures do not necessarily go with the figures pictured, but they were opened long ago and I've lost track. Figures that need replacement include Santa Jack (both legs fell off!) and Pumpkin King Jack (whose hand fell off).</p>\n"

All of the figures marked 'C3' were produced prior to the main line, before Art Asylum had the rights to produce mini figures by themselves. As a result, each of these came with a Lego-like construction kit called C3, which were notorious for missing pieces. Most valuable is the Martian Manhunter piece, as an important member of the JLU never reproduced as a lone figure.</p>\n"
