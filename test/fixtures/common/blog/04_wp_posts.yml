But now that the weekend’s playoff game against the New England Patriots has come and gone, we’ll get to wait a few months before we hear anything else about Tebow or his routine last-minute, game-winning heroics.\r\n<p>\r\nAnd after those months pass, <a href=\"http://www.topps.com/\">Topps</a> wants to be there, ready to get the conversation going. According to a post on <a href=\"http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/news/hobby-news/sign-of-the-times-topps-announces-tebow-autos-in-upcoming-products\">Sports Collectors Digest</a>, the company has unveiled a new line of cards featuring variations of number 15’s autograph. A post on the <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/sports-cards-and-memorabilia-in-harrisburg/topps-touts-tim-tebow-autographs-supreme-and-precision-football\">Examiner</a> explains that each pack of the Topps Supreme Football cards will cost a little less than $100 for only four cards, and that there are fewer than 65 Tebow-signed cards–total. Called “Tim Tebow Precision Comeback Autographs,” the cards will feature images of Tebow’s moments of glory, where he was able to steer his team through the first game in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, to offer the whole story of Tebow’s miracle season, I wonder whether or not they’ll offer any scenes from this past weekend’s run-ending thumping from the Patriots…\r\n<p>\r\nNah. Probably not.\r\n<p>\r\n[Via <em><a href=\"http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/news/hobby-news/sign-of-the-times-topps-announces-tebow-autos-in-upcoming-products\"> Sports Collectors Digest</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/sports-cards-and-memorabilia-in-harrisburg/topps-touts-tim-tebow-autographs-supreme-and-precision-football\">Examiner</a></em>]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n</div>"

    post_content: "During 2011's San Diego Comic Con, it was announced that two of my favorite collections were going to collide. No, not dust and despair - comic book superheroes and LEGO. After four months of heavy breathing and alarming fantasies best reserved for some serious psychoanalysis, DC Universe LEGO sets hit the local Toys 'R' Us right before Christmas, and my dreams were fulfilled.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/Picture-25.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-14568\" title=\"Picture 25\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/Picture-25.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"338\" /></a>I'm a huge Batman nerd, but it was without hesitation that I purchased the <strong>Superman vs. Power Armor Lex Luthor</strong> set before anything else, despite the proliferation of Bat-things on the shelf. This was the very first time that anyone but Batman, his pals and his rogues gallery was represented in the LEGO universe. After all, I already have the giant-scale LEGO Batmobile and old Arkham Asylum playset, as well as a handful of tag sale LEGO Batmen.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Justice League has arrived, and it's even cooler than the already rad picture on the box.\r\n\r\nSet 6862 comes with three figures (which is always a determining factor in a set's inherent coolness, honestly) : Superman, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor in his business suit. Fortunately, LEGO is using the most classic versions of these characters and not the \"New 52\" costumes which DC Comics has recently revealed, and which promise to dominate a large portion of DC's forthcoming merchandise.\r\n\r\nLEGO Superman and Wonder Woman are the simple highlights of this set, but the green-and-purple power suit is also pretty rad. <a href=\"http://www.collectorsquest.com/collectible/11255/superman-batman-lex-luthor\">Power Suit Lex figures</a> are some of my favorite, and <a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_lex_luthor_suit.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14567\" title=\"lego_lex_luthor_suit\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_lex_luthor_suit-300x265.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" /></a>while all of the iterations I'm familiar with are roughly Lex-sized suits of armor, I happily embrace this gargantuan mecha which Lex now pilots... and probably exists somewhere in the Silver Age anyhow. Grant Morrison, care to weigh in?\r\n\r\nThe Power Suit is a cross between LEGO's ball-jointed Hero Factory and Bionicle stuff, with an outer shell of more traditional LEGO pieces. This versatility of parts allows for a huge range of motion and action. Small, neon green, translucent caps glow like LEDs in the right light, and end each of the suit's articulated fingers, allowing the robot to grip heroes and toss them around. Two more rest in protective domes at the rear of the 'bot, like little orbs of kryptonite. The set takes this theme one further and furnishes the set with a kryptonite crystal inside of the robot's huge gun. It's bombastic comic narrative at its very best, all in a LEGO set.\r\n\r\nAt 207 pieces, the set takes about 15-20 minutes to assemble and is solid at every connection - which I discovered as a bumped into my TV and sent him toppling to the ground after ricocheting off of the Playstation.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_wonder_woman.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14561\" title=\"lego_wonder_woman\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_wonder_woman-208x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\nI've put together a good deal of LEGO's robot sets, designed and built my own robots from LEGO's now-doomed Digital Designer software, and this still feels like one of the best. Maybe it's just my nerd-lust talking, but I can't wait to stand this guy up in front of a LEGO White House as a complete Justice League battles in the foreground. LEGO Hawkman, I'm waiting for you. Without a doubt, this thing is worth the $20 tag on it - and there's much more to come! After Christmas passed, I sought for more DC LEGO stuff across three different Toys 'R' Us stores in a 50 mile radius and came up nearly empty, so these are ridiculously hot. If you can't find them now, they're definitely <a href=\"http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Superman-vs-Power-Armor-Lex-6862\">available on the LEGO website</a>. It may be worth holding off, as Toys 'R' Us is currently charging between 25% to 50% over suggested retail on the whole DC LEGO lineup, which will surely drop as the holidays fade into the distance once again. Of course, this is the same store which peeled all of the clearance stickers off of the unsellable Star Trek movie figures as Christmas approached, so date of purchase is actually pretty relevant to pricing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.collectorsquest.com/collection/3075/dc-universe-legos\">Check out the full DC LEGO gallery in our Community!</a>"

    post_content: "LEGO's <strong>Super Heroes</strong> line is a comic book-specific branch of their Hero Factory line : a set of Bionicle-like figures joined together by a superhero narrative and a robotic appearance. This time, LEGO is plumbing the DC Comics character roster (and later this year, the Marvel roster) to generate unusual 7\" figures of our favorite heroes and bad guys, starting with <strong>Batman</strong>, <strong>The Joker</strong> and <strong>Green Lantern</strong> Hal Jordan.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_full.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14578 aligncenter\" title=\"lego_batman_full\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_full.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"609\" /></a>\r\nUsing a basic, generic framework and a series of ball joints, the possibilities for DC characters seems infinite : slap a new head on a series of colored, standardized parts and you've got a completely new character. With this philosophy and the enormous library of existing LEGO parts, it shouldn't be long before we have a whole Justice League roster formed. While comparable Hero Factory figures are sold for around $10, Toys 'R' Us still gouges these for $20 each, Wal-Mart and LEGO's own website maintains a far more reasonable $15 per set. At an average of 45 pieces, these are relatively simple builds and take about ten minutes to assemble. The results are a minimalist interpretation of DC Comics core characters, and surprisingly interesting. What does LEGO distill these heroes down to? What visual elements are iconic enough to include, and which can be omitted for the sake of brevity? It's a very smart study in iconography. I might not agree with every choice, but even my most artistic sensibilities are sometimes thwarted by my nerdliness.</p>\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_portrait.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14577\" title=\"lego_batman_portrait\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_portrait-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"271\" height=\"203\" /></a>We start with <strong>Batman (Set 4526)</strong>. LEGO stuck with the traditional blue &amp; grey, yellow oval logo version of Batman, which I appreciate (while I would still love an all-black \"movie\" Batman in the future as well). Like all of this Super Heroes line, small pieces of curved shielding slip onto ball joints to bulk up the heroes' musculature in the most cubist way possible. None of these builds are that unexpected, making it all true to the LEGO form we're all familiar with. It's not a perfect Batman, but it's a perfect toy. Batman becomes a little strange, however, when it comes to his \"cape\".\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_back.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14575\" title=\"lego_batman_back\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_back.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\nRather than including a traditional, scalloped cape, Batman employs a series of black, ball-jointed projections tipped with blue spikes, which can be positioned in a spiny, cape-ish manner. Perhaps these are more akin to some kind of rocket-powered wing mechanisms, but it's definitely like something out of a mecha anime, and Batman's double-bladed sword object is also an nontraditional addition in terms of Batman's character - but it's kind of necessary to keep this in the realm of kid-friendly toys which can battle each other.</p>\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_stripped.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14573\" title=\"lego_batman_stripped\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2011/12/lego_batman_stripped.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"258\" height=\"343\" /></a>Of course, these are LEGOs - you can reconfigure them until you're completely content. I find that stripping down all of Batman's fancy augmentations leaves me with the Batman LEGO I'd really want - but I still find myself wishing for a cape. The side-mounted leg shield pieces tend to pop off in some poses, and may look as good as the front-mounted option (which other figures use), but once again : reconfiguration solves any problems you may have with this guy.\r\n\r\nOne thing about these Super Heroes figures is that their backs are sometimes left barren : a network of exposed pegs and hinges which don't add anything to the appearance of the figure. Fortunately, it's relatively easy to snap on a generic chest or arm shield (sometimes interchangeable on the more muscly heroes) to cover these pegs with a little clever engineering. One more, large shield piece per package would have been excellent.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/joker2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14594\" title=\"joker2\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/joker2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"358\" height=\"312\" /></a>\r\nI searched through 50 miles worth of stores until I found a single <strong>Joker (Set 4527)</strong>, a necessary foil to LEGO Batman and vital piece to add to my Joker shelf. A mix of battle armor, orange spikes, pointy hair and a translucent raygun, The Joker makes a very appropriate appearance as a teched-out, weirdo toy version of himself.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/joker5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14591\" title=\"joker5\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/joker5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"243\" height=\"317\" /></a>Using the same system of simple joints, The Joker uses a more elaborate joint system across his back to hold a pair of purple coattails which can flex upwards like a scorpion's tail, as well as a strange pair of spiked, evil-football-player shoulderpads. I don't completely understand the configuration, but once again, a reconfigured and stripped-down Joker brings him back to a more familiar, less exaggerated place.\r\n\r\nJoker's electric shock of a necktie is an interesting aesthetic addition, though the one I purchased had very melty colors bleeding across the piece. This isn't a negative thing so much as something which does not match the crisp LEGO look. It actually looks much better mounted atop his raygun piece, which appears in one of the manual's \"alternate configuration\" images. By switching out some grey pieces for some purple ones and simplifying a few things, we get a much more streamlined Joker, and still a formidable opponent for Batman.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/joker4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14592\" title=\"joker4\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/joker4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" /></a>\r\nI'm excited to see where this line goes, and which characters are embraced with this aesthetic. Will we score a much-maligned Martian Manhunter, or a bulked-out Darkseid? Some kind of convention exclusive Ambush Bug? I also can't wait to get even more pieces to modify these heroes into their perfect LEGO selves.

    post_content: "Since I've started writing posts about DVD collections here on Collectors' Quest, I've gradually become a student of weirdo cop shows. From <em><a href=\"http://collectorsquest.com/blog/2010/12/10/space-precinct-the-complete-series-on-dvd\">Space Precinct</a></em> to <em><a href=\"http://www.collectorsquest.com/blog/2011/06/11/saturday-morning-cartoon-round-up/\">Bravestarr</a></em>, and the classic <em><a href=\"http://collectorsquest.com/blog/2011/04/26/dvd-collectors-car-54-where-are-you-the-complete-first-season\">Car 54, Where Are You?</a></em>, I feel like I've watched a pretty wide swath of \"on the beat, but off the beaten path\" shows. I've never found myself to be a fan of realistic police dramas like <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, but something about watching crime go down in Mayberry is always entertaining for me. Somehow, I've amassed a pretty respectable collection of unusual TV DVDs which focus on law enforcement.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NKIPUO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=collques07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005NKIPUO\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-14623\" title=\"Sledge Hammer on DVD\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Picture-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"282\" height=\"377\" /></a>This week, I discovered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NKIPUO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=collques07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005NKIPUO\"><strong>Sledge Hammer!</strong></a> By the very inclusion of an exclamation point in its name, we know that this is going to be a great show. After all, most of my favorite properties have excitement built right into the title - <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, <em>Aaahh!!! Real Monsters</em>, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThis is a tale of gritty 80s cop show hyperbole, a show about the state of entertainment in the 1980s : a main character whose love of his gun compels him to treat it like a best friend, conversations and all, and who will never hesitate to use said friend to solve any and all problems he may encounter, from incapacitating a perp (but rarely killing them, thanks to 1980s censorship) to \"fixing\" a soda machine or turning out the lights. The crazy-eyed protagonist and anti-hero, named Sledge Hammer (obviously), presents a likeable, violent man : part Dexter Morgan, part Marvel's Punisher, and part Dirty Harry - all combined into one surreal comedy which embraces and thrives on entertainment stereotypes and tropes.\r\n\r\nFor 41 episodes, we're treated to a love song dedicated to the 1980s, still filmed in the 1980s. While this kind of thing could easily dip into bitter pop culture parody, <em>Sledge Hammer!</em> maintains a lightheatredness and affection for <em>Robocop</em> and Max Headroom. It may sound like a prolonged Saturday Night Live skit, and sometimes it is - but only from the best SNL era there was. And dammit if I don't miss the 80s.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Picture-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-14622\" title=\"Sledge Hammer! screenshot\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Picture-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" height=\"331\" /></a>\r\nImage Entertainment releases this on a 5-disc set. It's important to note that the pilot episode retains the pretty awful laugh track which ABC insisted the show include, but all other episodes leave it out (as engineered into Anchor Bay's earlier DVD release). It's not especially bothersome, as it shows the comparison between what was foisted upon the show by a network, and how good the show actually is. This is unsurprising, as it's been carefully crafted by some of the best talent behind <em>The Simpsons</em> (which is perhaps echoed in The Simpsons' over-the-top cop McBain segments). This set does omit some of earlier DVD extras : commentaries and documentaries, presenting a standard (but still solid) viewing experience. If you can't take my word for it, this series is has the largest collection of five-star reviews I've ever seen <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NKIPUO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=collques07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005NKIPUO\">on Amazon</a>.\r\n\r\nThis is a series which is definitely worth a view, and a warm reminder of 1980s comedy, before everything turned into bodily functions and... well, <em>Friends</em>. Or <em>Whitney</em>. When is someone going to just take that show out into a field and shoot it?\r\n\r\nI bet Sledge Hammer would."

    post_content: "LEGO's original LEGO Batman line, between 2006 and 2008, was something to behold : a wide variety of great characters and playsets assembled into a relatively complete portrait of Batman's troubled heroics, from the gigantic Arkham Asylum (7785) to a series of individual battles with Batman's gallery of rogues.\r\n\r\nThe original Batman Dragster / Catwoman Pursuit set (7779) can fetch a hefty price of $150 at auction, and includes Batman and Catwoman, as well as Catwoman's motorcycle and a Batman \"dragster\" - a racecar-like vehicle. <a href=\"http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Catwoman\">Brickipedia</a> offers some insight into the differences between these two Catwoman figures, as well as the many <a href=\"http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_%28Minifigure%29\">Batman</a> figures, if you're either a completist or a purist.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/catwoman1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14604\" title=\"catwoman1\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/catwoman1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" /></a>\r\nBut we're here to talk about LEGO's 2012 Super Heroes line, and Set 6858 - <strong>Catwoman Catcycle City Chase</strong>. I'm not sure if I'd consider this a \"replacement\" or an \"update\" for the original set, but for a suggested retail price of $13, it's certainly a fair price for a great little set.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/catwoman3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14601\" title=\"catwoman3\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/catwoman3-300x272.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"272\" /></a>This set includes a blue Batman, a new Catwoman, Catwoman's motorcycle (also new), and a scale model of a street corner - just to create a little atmosphere. At 89 pieces, this set takes about 10-15 minutes to assemble, and most of this work goes into putting together the diorama.\r\n\r\nBatman comes with a set of extended wings and a rocket pack which snaps onto his back. Once again, LEGO pops into Silver Age comic book hyperbole to craft a compelling narrative for kids, since us adults know that Batman would always opt for stealth over rocket packs - but I love it anyhow. Rocket Batman feels truer to form here than if it were a 6\" action figure, and heck, you can pop it right off should it offend you. While I prefer my Batmen caped, this is cape enough to be satisfying.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/batman1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14603\" title=\"batman1\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/batman1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"542\" height=\"488\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEach minifigure also comes with two face options which can be spun around, the rear of which is hidden by each characters' mask. Catwoman can be sassy or subtle, depending on how she plans on evading Batman this time.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/catwoman2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14602\" title=\"catwoman2\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/catwoman2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" /></a>\r\nIt might be weird, but my favorite part of this set is the cleverly crafted mailbox on the street corner : a few common bricks popped together and you have a completely recognizable form. Also surprisingly awesome (and universal) is the traffic light aspect of this. The set also includes a series of knock-down-able crates (as are present in any cinematic street chase). This little slice of urban life would be completely appropriate for any minifigure diorama, newspaper box and all. I only hope that future dioramas might complete this street scene, or at least add some breadth to it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Catwoman Catcycle City Chase</strong> is a very affordable first dip into the new LEGO DC Universe, and a quick way to snag a Batman minifigure. Now, let's get a mini-Joker for under $35 and we'll do some serious business. How about a blind-packed series of DC characters? I don't doubt that giganerds like myself would buy the heck out of those things.\r\n\r\nFor now, we've got 6 new DC LEGO sets, and that's a pretty great start - but I remain hungry for more. That's a good thing, LEGO. <a href=\"http://www.collectorsquest.com/collection/3075/dc-universe-legos\">For now, check out our DC Super Heroes LEGO gallery in our Community</a>!\r\n\r\n<em>[Catwoman Chase set graciously provided by LEGO!]</em>"

Of course, when you make a movie about people playing with giant toys, the toys naturally follow. One might suspect that a film of this nature would be made specifically to sell toys... but then, one might be too cynical to begin with.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jakks.com/\">Jakks Pacific</a> has taken over the task of capturing all of the movie's metal stars and transforming them into a convenient action figure scale, in both deluxe and basic formats. Despite their robotic exteriors, these robots have all established a surprisingly convincing set of personalities.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_wave_2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14712\" title=\"real_steel_wave_2\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_wave_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a>Wave 1 includes out hero, <strong>Atom</strong>, the samurai-themed, short-lived hero <strong>Noisy Boy</strong>, as well as enemy fighters <strong>Twin Cities</strong>, <strong>Midas</strong>, and the robot fighting champion : the imposing, black <strong>Zeus</strong>. Atom, Midas, Zeus, Noisy Boy are also available in a \"deluxe format\", which includes action features and more articulation. These are augmented by a second wave of awesome robots : <strong>Metro</strong>, a battle-damaged Zeus, a dirty, junkyard Atom, <strong>Six Shooter</strong>, and <strong>Ambush</strong>, as well as deluxe iterations of these robots (except for Ambush). These parts are all interchangeable, so you can make your very own robot creations and battle 'em out. Ten different robots from a single, non-Transformers movie is enough to get me fairly excited. We don't even talk about the Transformers movie in my house.\r\n\r\nBut your action figures aren't limited to plastic : if you have a printer and some patience, the <a href=\"http://steelgetsreal.com/\">Real Steel website</a> provides you with two different versions of Noisy Boy to make... out of paper! Check it out!\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6z5_xqqaQrE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6z5_xqqaQrE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n\r\nMedicom is never one to miss out on making products from a weird movie. Who else would have made <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> toys? A film about depressed, dysfunctional monster-animals messing up each others' lives? Medicom is back again - this time with Kubricks : miniature block figures. Two sets are available : Atom and Max (below), as well as Charlie and Noisy Boy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_kubricks1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14718\" title=\"real_steel_kubricks\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_kubricks1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"456\" /></a>But robots call for some serious action figures, too. <a href=\"http://www.bambasia.com/blog/?p=1736\">ThreeA (or 3A) showed off prototype images on their blog</a> for a 1/6th scale (roughly 15\" tall) figure of Ambush. While they've been silent about the production of these figures since November, they're a company known for making amazingly weathered robot figures, and have only recently started working in conjunction with licensed, robot properties in addition to the original creations of their founder, artist Ashley Wood. It goes without saying that I'm a collector of their super high-end action figures.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Ambush_3A_Real_steel.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-14714\" title=\"Ambush_3A_Real_steel\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Ambush_3A_Real_steel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"598\" />\r\n</a>I'm pretty sure I'd chase after one of these if and when they're actually released, just for the visual coolness factor alone. And if it's under $200. Promotional Real Steel wristbands and a set of five cards were also passed out at different nerd conventions in 2011, as well.\r\n\r\nAnd what set of movie merchandise would be complete without its own set of Hulk hands? For Real Steel, we get \"Atom Rumble Gloves\". Throw a punch, make a sound! I love toys which encourage you to hit and slash things. You're not a kid unless you're allowed to get hurt once in a while.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_gloves1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14719\" title=\"real_steel_gloves\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_gloves1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"320\" /></a>..but there's one exceptionally weird collectible from this film which continues to perplex me : Charlie's watch.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_watch.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14715\" title=\"real_steel_watch\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/real_steel_watch-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>This 'Real Steel Chronograph Replica' represents a watch which is, apparently, seen in the film - though it hardly holds the same import as, say, a titular Golden Gun, or the iconography of Thor's hammer. The semi-futuristic, visually overwrought watch from Styles on Video is certainly an interesting collectible from the film, but choosing to produce a watch is a very tangential way to get in on the Real Steel cult madness... which, unfortunately, never materialized.\r\n\r\nWhich is unfortunate - it's a completely charming movie. It's nice to watch a film that exists without guile, especially in a cinematic climate which embraces excessive drama and darkness. Petulant, estranged dads reconciling with equally petulant sons is as evil as this movie gets, and that's not so bad. And it happens to have a lot of robots in it, too. You can see the film yourself this week, replete with bonus features, on DVD and Blu-ray."

    post_content: "The mystery and the tragedy of the Titanic has captivated filmmakers and romantics since April of 1912, when the ship collided with an iceberg, and a word which had once meant \"enormous and powerful\" was lexically transformed into \"doomed\". During the intervening 100 years between then and now, this romanticized mystery became collectible : the desire for artifacts has always been great, as well as the desire for objects commemorating the event, as evidenced by the archive at <a href=\"http://www.titaniccollector.com/\">Titanic Collector</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_14638\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"490\" caption=\"(Don Emmert, AFP/Getty Images)\"]<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/titanic_artifact.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-14638\" title=\"Binoculars from Titanic\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/titanic_artifact.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"490\" height=\"320\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-titanic-auction-20120106,0,5673025.story\">LA Times</a> and Arlan Ettinger, not one single item found aboard the sunken Titanic has ever been sold to a private collector—which is why <a href=\"http://www.guernseys.com/\">Guernsey's Auctioneers &amp; Brokers</a>' auction this upcoming April is a pretty big deal. Of course, this collection is not to be confused with the many items which were recovered immediately after the wreck, culled from floating debris and lifeboats, which includes chessboards and picture frames made from the wood of the Titanic itself... and life vests cut from dead bodies. This collection consists of items which were recovered from the depths, trapped below the ocean for a very long time and often, perfectly preserved by the icy depths.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Picture-13.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-14641\" title=\"Picture 13\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Picture-13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"172\" height=\"391\" /></a>But wait! This statement isn't completely true, according to 401 Designs. They've received \"Certificate #1010\" from the US Government, which apparently entitles them to publicly sell only one type of item recovered from the sunken Titanic : coal. Their Internet presence barely exists beyond <a href=\"http://myworld.ebay.com/401designs/?_trksid=p4340.l2559\">the eBay page</a> where they sell their coal, so it's difficult to completely verify these claims, but if you'd like a little piece of the Titanic, and don't feel too ghoulish about it, you can have a pencil eraser-sized bit of coal, or coal compressed and embedded in a coin, or on a necklace.\r\n\r\nThe real collection, valued at $189 million dollars, comes with conditions : it must be purchased all at once, and a portion of the collection must always remain on display for the public to view. This isn't going to be a purchase made by an enthusiastic collector, but someone interested in the preservation of history, and all the intense maintenance which that task entails. So, sorry, Titanic buffs! You'll have to settle for your DiCaprio posters. And coal necklaces.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[via <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2012/01/titanic-artifacts-for-sale-from-trinkets-to-slab-of-hull.html\">Nation Now</a>.]"

    post_content: "<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/1986-pennant.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-14690\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/1986-pennant.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"217\" height=\"250\" /></a>Sports fans growing up in New York need to pick their allegiances wisely. Choosing which franchise to follow is usually a lifelong decision, often handed down by parents, family members, or friends—a son being born in a Yankees household will often follow his team more doggedly than the family's political party of choice.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what makes the New York Mets—and more specifically, the team's fans—such a tragic story in the world of the Empire State's sports. Mets fans are rarely made, but rather born to parents, who themselves were born into families who rooted for the long-gone Brooklyn Dodgers. As such, when the Mets maintain their years-long status as that <em>other</em> New York baseball team (am I going too far in calling them the LA Clippers of baseball?), their fans are unable to jump ship. Being a Mets fan ends two ways: quitting the sport altogether, or death.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a third option that seems to be more and more likely with each passing day: the Mets may simply disappear. The organization owes over $400 million to several banks and another $40 million to Bank of America alone, says an article in the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/sports/baseball/mets-hire-financial-firm-with-bankruptcy-savvy.html?_r=1\">New York Times</a></em> from earlier this month. Those figures don't factor in the $70 million they lost over the course of last season, and the $25 million they owe to Major League Baseball. The article discusses the fact that the Mets have hired CRG Partners, a company known to help ailing organizations turn things around and avoid bankruptcy—or to navigate the waters of bankruptcy to avoid utter destruction. Suffice it to say, the Mets need cash.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n\"Okay, okay, enough! We all know the Mets have even more trouble off the field than they do on the field! What in the name of Keith Hernandez's mustache does this have to do with collecting?\"\r\n\r\nI'm glad you asked. As it happens, <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/\">the Mets are literally auctioning off pieces of their stadium to raise money</a>. If that sounds like you've heard it before, it's not surprising: the Mets were selling every bit and piece of the now dearly departed Shea Stadium once their new stadium, Citi Field, was erected in 2009.\r\n\r\nBut it's something of a rarity, I believe, for a team to be auctioning off pieces of its stadium while it's still in use. Moreover, as a post on <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=7479458\">ESPN</a> rightly points out, the four year old stadium hasn't even seen any kind of great Mets action that would be worthy of remembering.\r\n\r\nSo what's on the auction block? Maybe some cool seats you can put in your living room, so you can recreate the stadium-feel when you're watching the 'Mazing Mets at home, right?\r\n\r\nWell, how about walls?\r\n\r\nThat's right: you can buy pieces of the stadium's walls, complete with gigantic advertisements.<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/wheat-verizon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14691\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/wheat-verizon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"201\" /></a>\r\nEver wanted to boldly proclaim your love for both baseball and <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337031&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683741\">Wheat Thins</a>? The Mets auction has you covered. And who wouldn't want to pay a thousand dollars for a <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337037&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683747\">giant Verizon advertisement</a>? I mean, I have Sprint, but still, it might be just what I need to really tie the room together.\r\n\r\nBut maybe these ad-festooned walls aren't so crazy. In a way, they're the perfect metaphor for the Mets themselves, costing tons of money and ultimately not bringing much satisfaction to those who've paid money for it. In that way, buying a chunk of wall might be the ultimate sign of Mets fandom.\r\n\r\nKidding aside, there are some actual bits of the stadium that might hold some meaning for Met fans. The various pennants earned by the team through the decades, including its <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337032&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683742\">1988</a> and <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337033&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683743\">2006</a> NL East Division Champion pennants, <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337034&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683744\">2000</a> National League Champions pennants, and the two pennants commemorating their <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337042&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683752\">1969</a> and <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174337043&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174683753\">1986</a> World Series Wins, to name a few, are available, with prices ranging from $700 to $1,500.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not the only one who thinks that these are the only bits of the stadium's walls worth paying for. As of this writing, so far they're the only items in the auction that have received any bids since they were first made available on January 17. And it's not like the bids are setting the world on fire…no item has received any bids beyond their starting prices. The wall segments will remain available until January 29, so I'd say it's possible that as word of the auctions spread among fans those items will start to see some action. But I have a feeling that the Wheat Thins and Lincoln ads are going to get tossed into a dumpster.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/shea-base.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14693 alignleft\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/shea-base-300x274.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"274\" /></a>However, there is, in fact, one item that hasn't gotten any action, and it might even be worth pursuing for serious Mets fans: an actual game-used <a href=\"http://mets.auction.mlb.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=174355571&amp;prmenbr=33339254&amp;aunbr=174702281\">base from Shea Stadium's final season in 2008</a>. Starting at $499, the base hasn't gotten any bids, and the auction ends in less than 24 hours from the time of this writing, leaving the auction block at 5 p.m., Friday, January 20. I have a feeling that the same kind of passion that makes a Mets fan stick with a team that disappoints them so often may take the plunge and rescue this artifact from better days. Well, marginally better days. You know what I mean.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not interested in walls <em>or</em> bases—there's only one thing I'd want to place a bid on: the head of Mr. Met. I'd have my Halloween costume set for life. That, or Keith Hernandez's mustache.\r\n\r\nOr maybe <em>both</em>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/mr-met.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14695\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/mr-met-276x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"276\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">[Via the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/sports/baseball/mets-hire-financial-firm-with-bankruptcy-savvy.html?_r=1\">New York Times</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=7479458\">ESPN</a></em>]</p>\r\n\r\n</div>"

But when stories like the one in this post crop up, it's hard to figure out how they've even made it this far without imploding.\r\n\r\nAccording to an article in the <em><a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20120120/NEWS06/201200404/Man-accuses-post-office-of-losing-expensive-baseball-card-collection-jewelry?odyssey=tab\">Detroit Free Press</a></em>, sports memorabilia collector Anthony Johnson, a resident of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, has been struggling to reclaim his collectibles after an unfortunate experience with a house guest. Back in 2009, another collector from Los Angeles was staying at his house and managed to steal several thousands of dollars in cash, as well as his baseball card and sports memorabilia collection valued at about $329,000.\r\n\r\nThe article notes some of the particular gems of Johnson's collection that were stolen, including a Rolex watch and gold chain once owned by NBA player Derrick Coleman, a mint condition Joe DiMaggio card from 1938, a '51 Mickey Mantle card, a mint '52 Mantle card, and a signed Hank Aaron card from 1967 in mint condition.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Johnson wanted to get this stuff back. I never even owned this stuff, and <em>I</em> want it all back.\r\n\r\nHere's where things get weird: the thief shipped the ill-gotten goods through the USPS back to LA, but when Johnston alerted the postal service, the goods were caught mid-transit. Good news, right? Wrong.\r\n\r\nWhile the post office was able to send Johnson thirty grand of his stolen money, the rest of the goods seem to have gotten lost in the shuffle somehow.\r\n\r\nFrom the article:\r\n<blockquote>\"Johnson said the package was sent to Detroit, but wound up at a postal facility in Atlanta, where it sat for about 18 months. Eventually, it was forwarded to Detroit and inventoried by a postal inspector [t]here [...] Johnson's insurance carrier won't pay for the missing property because it says the postal service is responsible. But the postal service refused to pay, saying it wasn't negligent...\"</blockquote>\r\nYikes.\r\n\r\n\"I'm really upset about this...it's been a three-year runaround,\" Johnson is quoted as saying in the piece.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Johnson has filed suit against the postal service, and a U.S. District judge has been assigned to the case. One way or another, I hope this gets resolved soon. As to where the package has wound up after it was inventoried in Detroit remains a mystery.\r\n\r\nIf only the thief had decided to use FedEx...\r\n\r\n[Via <em><a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20120120/NEWS06/201200404/Man-accuses-post-office-of-losing-expensive-baseball-card-collection-jewelry?odyssey=tab\">Detroit Free Press</a></em>]"

The playoffs are in full swing, and teams' fortunes are rising and falling with each game, with the Super Bowl only a short while away. With the playoffs comes more heat on taking a piece of the games you love (or loathe) home with you. But when it comes to getting a jersey worn by your favorite player, it turns out that appearances can be deceiving.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, the <em><a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-13/news/ct-met-jersey-fraud-1213-20111213_1_game-jerseys-collectors-memorabilia\">Chicago Tribune</a></em> ran an interesting, in-depth analysis of a scandal that has rocked the collectibles industry. A Las Vegas-based company, <a href=\"http://www.josportsco.com/\">JO Sports</a>, has enjoyed contracts with over a dozen pro-football teams for years now, receiving \"authenticated\" jerseys from the teams themselves, which they were then authorized to sell to collectors.\r\n\r\nBut back in November, the company’s owner, Jarrod Oldridge, pleaded guilty to doctoring jerseys and selling them to collectors. He now faces up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Between 2004 and 2008, employees of JO Sports would swap numbers on jerseys, as well as \"roughening, scuffing, washing, [and] dirtying\" the jerseys to make them seem more authentic, I guess. In addition, the jerseys came with forged certificates of authenticity.\r\n\r\nBut while the New York Giants and Baltimore Ravens are looking to cut ties with the company—which is still open despite Oldridge having pleaded guilty to the crimes—the Chicago Bears still have yet to terminate their contract with JO Sports. Can you believe it? As if Bears fans didn’t have enough to feel bad about after missing the playoffs…\r\n\r\nWhat’s the upshot of this whole story? Basically, sports memorabilia—jerseys in particular—are big, big business, and people don’t mind making lots of money off of your passions. <a href=\"http://www.josportsco.com/list_products.asp?NewSearch=True&amp;SubID=7000000&amp;TeamID=6000035&amp;CatID=5000009\">JO Sports' website has listings</a> for jerseys worn by the New York Giants in their win against the Buffalo Bills from this season, with the lowest priced jersey being that of Michael Coe, coming in at $750. Osi Umenyiora's jersey runs a staggering two-grand from the same game—and this is all from a company whose owner faces jail time because of forgeries. In short, unless you see the guy take off the jersey and hand it to you, you never really know what you’re going to get.\r\n\r\nWe all want to take a part of the game home with us, but it’s better to make sure that what you’re getting is really a part of the game.\r\n\r\n[Via <em><a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-13/news/ct-met-jersey-fraud-1213-20111213_1_game-jerseys-collectors-memorabilia\">Chicago Tribune</a></em>]"

    post_content: "Classic rock and pinball have always been intertwined, making beautiful, solenoid-filled babies together - from <a href=\"http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=1386\">Bally's 1978 KISS machine</a>, to <a href=\"http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=2579\">Data East's 1994 Tomm</a>y, and <a href=\"http://www.ipdb.org/search.pl?any=rolling+stones&amp;sortby=name&amp;search=Search+Database&amp;searchtype=quick#2010\">both 1979 and 2011 Rolling Stones machines</a> - but this month, Stern (the world's only surviving pinball macufacturer) has released their <a href=\"http://www.sternpinball.com/Games/acdc-pro.aspx\">AC/DC pinball machine</a>!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/acdcpinball001.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-14706\" title=\"acdcpinball001\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/acdcpinball001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"354\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA quick shot of the playfield reveals a plethora of graphics and a molded \"Hell's Bells\" accessory, as well as a very neat jukebox setup near the rear of the field. Yes, all twelve songs represented there are included on this machine, in full (accessible through a menu and not tricky bumper shots, according to Stern). While looking at Angus Young's snarling, smarmy face for hours might be not be the most pleasant experience, it's sure to be mitigated by the fact that pinball cures almost all ills. Even pervasive ugliness.\r\n\r\nFour different editions of this machine are available : a basic model (which usually drops out a few points of functionality to keep the price down, such as magnets or playfield accessories), a 'Premium' model (which is generally the full game), and two special editions : \"Back in Black\" limited to 300, and \"Let There Be Rock\", limited to 200 and featuring the exact same art and playfield, but with black and red color schemes respectively, as well as numbered plaques. Prices range from $5000 to $7500 for these various editions.\r\n\r\nDespite their size and pricetag, pinball collecting is alive and well and thriving on pinball's enormous aftermarket, and the repairability of most machines and their many moving and/or electronic parts, thanks to a few loyal suppliers and an online group of hundreds of technologically adept enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nThanks, Stern, for keeping pinball alive and giving collectors new holy grails a few times every year. This will look great next to your <a href=\"http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=1687\">Ted Nugent</a> setup.\r\n\r\n[via <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sternpinball\">Stern's Facebook</a>]"

    post_content: "Born from the overactive mind of Doug TenApel, <strong>Earthworm Jim</strong> is a property which generated some of the 1990s best video games, TV shows and action figures. A true tale of the underdog... or underworm, as the case may be, stumbling into a super-powered suit and gaining sentience, enhancing his natural proclivity towards heroism. Subsequently, Jim fights evil in all forms, be it malevolent filing cabinets, destructive space Corvidae, or missing egg beaters. Jim remains an under-appreciated, cult character who has suffered though decades of DVD neglect and a handful of action figures which were advertised, but never released, by Playmates Toys. EWJ collectibles are minimal, but all pretty rad : Taco Bell giveaways, eight action figures, a couple of VHS tapes, and that's pretty much it.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_14723\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"544\" caption=\"Earthworm Jim 6&quot; Figure from Mezco\"]<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/MEZCO_earthworm_jim.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-14723\" title=\"MEZCO_earthworm_jim\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/MEZCO_earthworm_jim.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"408\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nThis year, <a href=\"http://www.mezcotoyz.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=1056\">Mezco Toyz</a> (with a 'z') is taking the reins and releasing a new 6\" scaled Earthworm Jim action figure, and it's better than ever before. This time, Jim is fully articulated and comes with a worm body which slips into the super suit. Coming out in the summer of 2012 for about $17, here's hoping that Mezco busts out a few more great EWJ characters : Psy-crow, Princess What's Her Name, Professor Monkey for a Head, and finally, a semi-epic Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt."

Every so often an object comes along that holds much, much more significance because of who it came from, and why it's given. Case in point: an article on <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ro-rogers_eric_abidal_cancer_rolex_teenager_012312\">Yahoo! Sports</a> offers details on a gift from a star defender on Barcelona's soccer team, Eric Abidal, a survivor of liver cancer.\r\n\r\nA 15-year-old Barcelona fan, Juan Garcia, is fighting against a brain tumor, and his father has been trying to keep that fight alive in his son with stories of Abidal's victory against the disease.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I was able to tell my son was, 'You have in your head the same thing Abidal had in his liver, and tomorrow they will take it out,'\" his father, J. Garcia Serra, is quoted as saying. \"My son said, 'Dad get me the shirt of Abidal; I will fight like him and will win my own Champions League.'\"\r\n\r\nWearing the jersey of his hero, Garcia went into the operating theater and has since been receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatments. But on January 5, players from Barcelona visited him in the hospital--including Abidal himself.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/abidal-watch1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14737\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/abidal-watch1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"272\" /></a>And what did Abidal give to his ailing fan? He took off his Rolex Daytona watch, which is normally valued at $30,000, and presented it to Garcia as a gift. It's not confirmed, but the article explains that the watch may be more than simply an expensive timepiece. It's possible that it's a limited edition watch that Barcelona's team members received after winning both Spain's La Liga and the Champions League, while other sources speculate that the watch may be a prize Abidal had received for winning Barcelona fans' player of the year award.\r\n\r\nBut more than just the watch itself, Abidal also had some words of inspiration and encouragement for young Garcia:\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, brother, I am here to give you courage. I am also fighting against this disease,\" said Abidal to Garcia, according to the boy's father. He also said, \"It doesn't matter what this [watch] is worth. I want your son to be happy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that no mere watch--no matter how expensive or valuable--can cure a sick body, the gift itself is significant. Worn by not only the boy's hero, but a survivor, the watch as an object is symbolically meaningful. As Garcia recovers and keeps fighting the disease, the watch will continue to tick, counting the seconds, minutes, hours, and days that he's going to keep on fighting...and keep on living.\r\n\r\n[Via <em><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ro-rogers_eric_abidal_cancer_rolex_teenager_012312\">Yahoo!

    post_content: "<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/manning-3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14752\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/manning-3-199x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" /></a>This past Sunday, we were treated to two tight, anxiety-inducing match-ups between some of this year's best NFL teams.\r\n\r\nAnd also the New York Giants were there.\r\n\r\nWhatever your feelings on whether or not the Giants deserved to make it so far in the playoffs, the facts remain: the team that couldn't excel  in the regular season has pulled through in the clutch, vaulting over the competition in the playoffs, and scoring the first conference championship for New York since 2007.\r\n\r\nThat year, the Giants went up against the New England Patriots in the Super bowl--and what do you know? The two rivals are going at it again for what's sure to be one of the most exciting rematches in NFL history. Having grown up in New York for almost 30 years--and despite my loyalty to the Jets--I'm pleased to see the Giants looking to take down that most hated of franchises (at least in my house), Tom Brady and the Patriots.\r\n\r\nBut there's just one thing that bugs me about it all: Eli Manning's head.\r\n\r\nI'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about. Throughout the game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, quarterback Manning's oversized helmet stood out among the other players on the field. A 2010 article from <em><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/864021--hey-eli-great-gazoo-wants-his-helmet-back\">The Toronto Star</a> </em>explains that the larger-size helmet is purely a safety precaution. And given how many times the Giants' defense let Eli get slammed to the ground on Sunday's game, he cold use all the protection he could get.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/manning-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14753\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/manning-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>As it turns out, though, while he may look like a doofus on the field, Manning is still coming out on top in terms of memorabilia sales--at least according to the hometown paper, the <em><a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/eli_king_of_new_jer_eys_deZS4XksYfVTdQnHpI3PbL\">New York Post</a></em>. According to the article, Manning-merch has jumped up in value by 10 percent in the last few years, making him the most valuable  player for the Giants past and present...well, in dollars for sure. We'll see what he does against the Pats in two weeks.\r\n\r\nBut back to that giant Giants helmet. The <em>Post </em>article points out that an autographed, game-worn Manning helmet was fetching $7,000 on eBay--and that was before the conference win this past weekend. In addition, signed jerseys sell for $800, while game-worn jerseys were going for $4,500.\r\n\r\nJust make sure you get the <a href=\"http://www.collectorsquest.com/blog/2012/01/19/jersey-jerks-the-danger-of-buying-game-jerseys-from-a-third-party/\">genuine article</a> before you shell out that much cash, of course.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/manning-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14754\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/manning-1-300x273.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"273\" /></a>The article goes on to point out that this season has brought Manning a lot more popularity nationwide, as his jersey has become the eighth-most popular sold in 2011...beating out his older brother, Indianapolis Colts' QB Peyton Manning, whose injuries brought him from ninth-most popular all the way down to the 17th. It only stands to reason that if the Giants are victorious at the big game, the popularity and the value of the merchandise bearing his name and number will only shoot up even higher. And if they lose...well, we'll just have to see how bad a loss it is before we make any predictions there.\r\n\r\nSo, as it turns out, Manning's got plenty of reasons to have a big head besides just protecting his brains. He's one of the most popular quarterbacks in the NFL, and his merch moves like hotcakes. Blue and red hotcakes, with cleat marks in them.\r\n\r\nLet's hope that all this success on the field and on eBay doesn't quite go to his head before the big game against the Patriots in two weeks.\r\n\r\nI mean, if his head got any bigger, he might tip over. And that happens plenty already.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/sack-11.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14748\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/sack-11-300x262.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"262\" /></a><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/sack-21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14749\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/sack-21-300x221.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"221\" /></a><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/sack-31.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14750\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/sack-31-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /></a>Ouch.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">[Via <em><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/864021--hey-eli-great-gazoo-wants-his-helmet-back\">The Toronto Star</a> </em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/eli_king_of_new_jer_eys_deZS4XksYfVTdQnHpI3PbL\">New York Post</a></em>]</p>"

    post_content: "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-align: left;\">BMW markets their cars as the ultimate driving machine. I believe they have also created the ultimate collectibles. The BMW Art Car collection is entirely owned by BMW so private collectors will have to be content with reproductions. The first of the BMW art cars was created in 1975 when race driver Hervé Poulain asked his friend Alexandar Calder to paint his BMW 3.0 CSL to be raced at the 24 Hours at <a href=\"http://www.lemans.org/en/\">Le Mans</a>. While the car did not finish the race, its legacy has continued with another 16 cars being created by various artists including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, Jenny Holzer and more.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What really excites me about the BMW art cars is the large number of them that have been put at risk in a race. I try to imagine seeing a one of a kind masterpiece flying by me at 150 miles per hour, knowing that a wrong move could destroy it. I imagine the pressure put on the drivers of these cars as they are both driving to win the race and preserve the beauty that surrounds them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"The original 1977 BMW 320i Turbo designed by Roy Lichtenstein.\"]<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dIxVV23A4Qeo31GV2hQdD76IGHAGPz1ugU07XgK2flmSICRN-v5xyE4TZo2kmFwaYmpKUq4Zi_k1nIYXDHiC_zC8UKGBuk-duq1kXydu-LQVsJx0Sb8\" alt=\"\" width=\"500px;\" height=\"362px;\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nBetween 2003 and 2005, BMW released a series of 1:18 replicas of all the art cars to that point. These cars were exquisitely crafted by <a href=\"http://www.minichampsna.com/\">Minichamps</a> and packaged with a book detailing all of the art cars. Most of the cars have been sold out with only a few of the less famous of the cars remaining in stock. The Jenny Holzer designed 1999 BMW V12 LMR is one of the hardest to find from the series and has fetched prices well over 10 times what it was originally sold for.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"The 1999 BMW V12 LMR designed by Jenny Holzer reproduced at 1/18 scale by Minichamps.\"]<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/le4Td5D1qFH2FUW_WjYFuMS-m36A-caT4GrTPW3rhcmbJS4YoctwgHWedCCyJKmsXcsfkIh5X8hVUno-ihBMHDbALcoahDf0cLE5FRRDtXYL7kCcuoY\" alt=\"\" width=\"500px;\" height=\"336px;\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nFor slot car collectors, <a href=\"http://www.flymodelcars.com/\">Fly Model Cars</a> released fantastically packaged 1/32 reproductions. Like the original cars they are modeled after, these cars were built to see action. If you find one for sale, be prepared to spend at least $100 for one that’s been used and much more with original packaging.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"The 1975 3.0 CSL originally painted by Alexander Calder reproduced as a 1/32 scale slot car by Fly Model Cars. This is the car that started the whole thing.\"]<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5clFbrKccQ7FjKu0hhl5fvCzrNxFSGTC7LZKjbpxXHLT18SjRVaQcWz8Y-nbHCZqQRHCwUdg3nnMRBe3cj6U3v6-O8ld4YDGxt-Av2S_Dpshfe7UFRw\" alt=\"\" width=\"500px;\" height=\"375px;\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of promotional posters printed to announce showings at various galleries around the world. These posters can be harder to find than the models of the cars but are much more affordable and still a real treat to look at.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"Poster for the 1990 world tour of the BMW Art Car exhibition.\"]<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mgXAqnGco_fSdsYz8nKJAbCOkdqfNJGCUPUTqkf84SK0woA6Tz3mjdoYLPqz9fUErBOaoYMQHPjZUuhuQ8vT3jTbbQuXdqRyx1B-DNNFj5yBpMgczzs\" alt=\"\" width=\"500px;\" height=\"329px;\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nWhat started as a driver looking for something special for his car has turned out to be an epic undertaking by a car manufacturer. It is unlikely that BMW will ever sell any of the Art Cars so putting a price on them is kind of silly. There have been additional BMW Art Cars created by several artists that are not considered to be part of the official collection because they were not commissioned by BMW directly. While not official, they are still worth seeking out to appreciate.\r\n\r\nFor people looking for a more immediate entry into the world of the BMW Art Car, I recommend printing and building the Rauschenberg painted 1986 BMW 635 CSi that has been recreated by digital artist JMV, found <a title=\"Rauschenberg\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmv/127284411/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE in his Flickr account</a>."

    post_content: "This is one of those cars that has it all; performance, styling, celebrity and a racing heritage filled with wins at some of the most prestigious races of the time. Add those features together and then limit production to 1,400 units and you have all the makings of a car that collectors drool over. Your average 300SL (if there is such a thing) regularly fetches prices over $500,000 for collectors able to find them.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's not enough for some collectors. They know about the alloy bodied version of the 300SL. Every bit of beauty was enhanced when Mercedes-Benz took the already light car and made it even lighter, lower and ready for the track. There were only 29 of the alloy bodied versions manufactured and they rarely change hands.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_14836\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"Photo by Pawel Litwinski, courtesy Gooding &amp; Company\"]<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/300SL-Gooding.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14836\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/300SL-Gooding.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Pawel Litwinski, courtesy Gooding &amp; Company\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nThis past weekend, <a title=\"1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Alloy Gullwing at Gooding &amp; Company\" href=\"http://www.goodingco.com/car/1955-mercedes-benz-300-sl-alloy-gullwing\" target=\"_blank\">Gooding &amp; Company</a> auctioned off car #6 out of the 29 in Arizona for a record setting $4.2 million dollars (that's $4.62 million when you work in the 10% auction fees the buyer had to pay on top of the winning bid).\r\n\r\nI can only imagine what one of the Uhlenhaut coupés would fetch if they ever went to auction. These two company cars were developed with Formula 1 engines to dominate at the the Mille Miglia or the 24 Hours of Le Mans but ended up the personal cars of Rudolf Uhlenhaut which he drove with absolute joy to and from the office every day. While there is no chance of seeing one crossing the auction block any time soon, collectors can enjoy the 1:18 scale model from <a href=\"http://www.cmc-modelcars.de/shop/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=10&amp;products_id=104&amp;osCsid=2dfb4e27fcefcf652355a08ca6302437\" target=\"_blank\">CMC model cars</a> on their desk every day.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_14866\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR &quot;Uhlenhaut Coupe&quot; in 1:18 scale by CMC model cars\"]<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/300SL-CMC1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14866\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/300SL-CMC1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe 300SL Gullwing is such a beloved car that it's hard to find a model car company that doesn't make a version of this dream machine.

    post_content: "<div><a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/2012-year-of-the-dragon-fan-coin-china-both.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14824\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/2012-year-of-the-dragon-fan-coin-china-both.jpg\" alt=\"China fan coin and traditional coin\" width=\"280\" height=\"227\" /></a>Happy Chinese New Year, all! Last Monday, January 23rd, marked the first day of the new lunar year on the Chinese calendar, and numismatists have been looking forward to the new batch of commemorative coins honoring the Year of the Dragon. The Perth Mint has the most offerings, ranging from <a href=\"http://www.apmex.com/Product/66386/default.aspx\">Tuvalu's Nick-Jr-esque dragon</a> to <a href=\"http://eurocollections.com/store/product.asp?id=6794\">rectangle Cook Island \"coins\"</a>, but for my money the best Chinese New Year coins come right from the source.</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>In the year 2000, <a href=\"http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/963/index.html\">The People's Bank of China</a> released their first fan-shaped Chinese New Year coin: the dragon. These do not look like a coin in the traditional sense, aside from being marked with a 10 yuan face-value. Evoking the shape of the sweep of paper of an opened traditional Chinese fan, these coins are an arc of metal, each with a different zodiac symbol on the reverse. For twelve years China has released a new 'fan' coin for each new symbol of the Chinese lunar-zodiac, until the year of the rabbit in 2011 ended the cycle.</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>If you've been collecting these fan-coins since 2000, you've finally completed the ring. Each of the fan-coins is designed to be one-twelfth of the circumference of a circle, so when <a href=\"http://www.sunfeico.com/fan_animal.htm\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14826\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/chinese-zodiac-fan-coins-300x268.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"268\" /></a>each of the 12 coins is put end-to-end they make a complete ring. For each zodiac symbol, the People's Bank produced two versions: a 1-ounce .999 silver and a 1/3-ounce .999 gold. The gold coins are slightly smaller than the silver, and the complete circle made by the gold fan-shaped coins fits neatly inside the silver coin ring. Displayed properly, these make a much more striking presentation than most coins.</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>With the coming of the 2012 Chinese New Year, the Chinese calendar has circumnavigated all 12 symbols of the lunar zodiac and has come back to the Year of the Dragon. The People's Bank has started a new series, <a href=\"http://www.pandaamerica.com/details.asp?item=10482&amp;grp=1&amp;categ=1\">with a new dragon coin</a>, done in the same circular style.</div>\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14829\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/2012-year-of-the-dragon-plum-blossom-coin-china.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"201\" />\r\n<div>If the fans are too untraditional for you, China has also minted a variety of other commemorative and collectible coins for the new year. Almost as striking as the fans are the plum-blossom coins. Flower-shaped coins have been minted in China for hundreds of years, and the scalloped petal shape has come to stand for good luck, prosperity, and persistence. Three coins have been made this year with the flower shape: a 1/2-ounce gold coin, a 1-ounce silver coin, and if those are just too small, you can get the 1kg (that's over 2 pounds) gold coin. Don't worry, if that's not enough gold too, China has also minted a 10kg gold medallion. Only 18 of the 10kg coins were minted, so I'm sure they're going fast.</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<div>All together, the People's Bank of China has released fifteen coins and medallions commemorating the lunar new year, in enough sizes and shapes to satisfy any collector. If you'd like to see all of the coins produced for The Year of the Dragon from all the other countries, too, <a href=\"http://monetastic.ning.com/forum/topics/year-of-the-dragon\">Monetastic has a nice round-up</a>, complete with images of both the obverse and reverse of the various coins minted for the lunar new year.</div>"

    post_content: "For the past few years, Hagerty, a world leader in classic car insurance, has tasked themselves with creating a list of the top future collectibles available to the average man. Two years ago the list was capped at cars costing less than <a title=\"Hagerty Announces Its' Annual Hagerty Hot List: Top 10 Future Collector Cars Under $50,000\" href=\"http://www.hagerty.com/Hagerty-corporate/Press/Press-releases/2009/01/01/HAGERTY-ANNOUNCES-ITS-ANNUAL\">$50,000</a>. Last year that price jumped up to <a title=\"2011 Hot List: 10 future classics under $100K\" href=\"http://www.hagerty.com/classic-car-articles-resources/HowTo/Buying-and-Selling/All-articles/2010/12/02/2011-Hot-List-10-future-classics-under-100K\">$100,000</a> to be able to include some of the \"budget\" exotic cars.\r\n\r\nGiven all of the variables involved, it can be hard work to predict the future. It's hard to know if placement in a popular movie, a successful campaign at the race track or even a viral video on YouTube may drive the prices of a particular car. With their years of experience, the folks at Hagerty gave us this vision of the future collectible market.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_14898\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\" caption=\"Future Classic? The 2012 Buick Regal GS\"]<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/buick-regal-gs-press.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14898\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/buick-regal-gs-press.jpg\" alt=\"Future Classic? The 2012 Buick Regal GS\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nI'm not going to argue with a crew that has as much experience with car values as the folks over at Hagerty but I do have to question the presence of the Jeep and Buick while the <a title=\"2012 Cadillac CTS-V Wagon\" href=\"http://www.cadillac.com/cts-v-luxury-wagon.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cadillac CTS-V Wagon</a> and <a title=\"The BMW 1 Series M Coupe.\" href=\"https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/p/pcgl/pressDetail.html?outputChannelId=6&amp;id=T0091933EN&amp;left_menu_item=node__6068\" target=\"_blank\">BMW 1 Series M Coupe</a> are both absent.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what the future holds for any of these cars, I hope the people that own them get to enjoy the thrill of driving them every day. While I haven't been behind the wheel of the Buick myself, every review I've read so far indicates it is a great ride that hopes to shake off the fuddy duddy reputation the marque has been shackled with.\r\n\r\nThe official Press Release\r\n<blockquote>2012 Hagerty Hot List: 10 Future Collector Cars Under $100,000\r\n\r\nTRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (January 26, 2012) – Hagerty, the world leader in classic car insurance and host to the largest database of classic cars, today announced its annual \"Hagerty Hot List\" of new vehicles that stand above their mass-produced peers. The announcement comes on the heels of the annual Scottsdale collector car auction week, a Mecca for classic car enthusiasts and the place where collector car values are established for the year ahead. With so many world-record breaking sales and increasing values, consumers may be wondering what cars have the best future collectability.\r\n\r\n\"After more than twenty years of witnessing car-collecting trends, we have the unique ability to look at new cars through the eyes of a collector,\" said McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty Insurance. \"This year's Hot List includes cars that are sure to develop a cult-like following because their characteristics resonate with driving enthusiasts.\"\r\n\r\nEach year Hagerty asks its team of valuations experts to select which mass-produced vehicles with a MSRP of less than $100,000 will one day become collectible. The 2012 Hagerty Hot List (along with base price) is:\r\n\r\n1. Buick Regal GS ($32,535) – It has been quite a long time since we could say \"that isn't your Grandpa's Buick.\" Surprisingly, at a time when allegedly more sporting makes don't offer real three-pedal manual transmissions, Buick is doing it with the Regal GS.\r\n\r\n2. Ford Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca Edition ($48,100) – Ford is calling this a \"race car with a license plate,\" and it pays homage to the original and very collectible Boss 302. It is a beast on the race track, yet tame enough to drive on the street – and all for less than $50,000.\r\n\r\n3. Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 ($61,785) – Let's face it, Americans love SUVs. The problem is most SUVs don't handle as impressively as they look. The SRT8 version of the Grand Cherokee takes the rugged, go-anywhere look of an SUV and combines it with performance characteristics that would earn respect on a race track.\r\n\r\n4. Fiat 500 Abarth ($22,000) – With a 160 horsepower, 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, Abarth-tuned suspension, brakes and dual exhaust, the latest in-house-tuned Fiat recalls the \"small but wicked\" models from the past. Fiat's performance division also includes complimentary admission to the Abarth Driving Experience with each purchase. The cognoscenti line has formed.\r\n\r\n5. Volkswagen Golf R ($36,000) – The Golf's ancestor, the MK I GTI from the early 1980s, is now a legitimate collectible, and the rare 2004 Golf R32 is headed in that direction. The new, all-wheel drive Golf R is geared towards someone who enjoys driving and evokes the same \"pocket-rocket\" characteristics of its forbearers.\r\n\r\n6. Porsche 911 ($82,100) – The Porsche legacy is built around the 911. Every generation runs the course from being fun used cars for good buys to eventually swelling in value. If you are most concerned about a car holding its value over the long term, then this is the car on this list to buy now and lovingly keep.\r\n\r\n7. Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 ($54,095) – Since 2005, the current generation of Shelby Mustangs has owned the king-of-the-hill position in the pony car segment. The new ZL1 Camaro with 580 horsepower brings Chevy back into the hunt and demonstrates that old-school muscle is alive and well.\r\n\r\n8. Nissan GT-R Black Edition ($95,100) – Until this year, this is the car that young people in the U.S. have only been able to experience on video games. It manages to squeeze 530 horsepower out of a six-cylinder engine. While the invoice price is out of reach for most in the younger generation, we predict they will remember these cars years down the road after their student loans are paid off.\r\n\r\n9. Dodge Charger SRT8 ($46,795) – What won us over is the giant touch screen in the center of the dash. And not for the reasons you are thinking. It has \"performance pages\" that feed input to the driver about performance statistics such as available horsepower and torque.\r\n\r\n10. Audi TT RS ($56,850) – For people who won't buy a Porsche because they haven't won Le Mans in quite a while, the Audi TT RS is the answer. This is a car with global appeal, which means it will have global demand several decades down the road.</blockquote>"

    post_content: "<a href=\"http://pipedreams.publicradio.org/events/miami_organ_weekend/milhous_gallery/milhous_pics.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">The Milhous Collection</a>, one of the world's most extraordinary and eclectic private collections, will go up for sale this February 24 and 25 via <a href=\"http://www.rmauctions.com/milhous-collection.cfm#\" target=\"_blank\">RM Auctions</a>, in association <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2012/milhous-collection-n08845/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">with Sotheby's</a>, and is expected to bring an estimated $40 million.\r\n\r\nThe collection belongs to Bob and Paul Milhous, distant cousins of President Richard Milhous Nixon, and has been housed in a one-of-a-kind, 39,000-square-foot, private museum which had only been open to the public during charity events. The collection began in 1959 and contains everything from giant toy soldiers from New York's famed FAO Schwarz to rare automobiles, from funhouse mirrors and carnival sideshow banners to more traditional Americana, such as gas pumps. However, The Milhous Collection is most noted for its world-class vintage and antique orchestrions, mechanical musical instruments,  fair, dance, and theatre organs.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Gaudin-125-Key-Dance-Organ-Milhous-Collection-500.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14913\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/Gaudin-125-Key-Dance-Organ-Milhous-Collection-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"259\" /></a>\r\n\r\nCentral to the collection, and expected to fetch between $1,000,000 - $1,500,000, is the Illions-style carousel. Custom-built for the brothers who couldn't find just the right carousel themselves, this carousel took over four years to build and features an amazing 44 animal figures -- each carved by hand from historically accurate designs.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/custom-built-Milhous-carousel-with-42-hand-carved-animals-500.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14914\" src=\"/uploads/blog/2012/01/custom-built-Milhous-carousel-with-42-hand-carved-animals-500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLook at the video below to take a tour and see so much more of what the collection holds!\r\n\r\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDOZ5sNnr9A&version=3&hl=en_US]\r\nPhotos by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gZH-QIBlO89kJS6T4et-0QTXoi-A?docId=6af1831ce5b140e1851c6416f56b8b6d\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Diaz for the Associated Press</a>."
