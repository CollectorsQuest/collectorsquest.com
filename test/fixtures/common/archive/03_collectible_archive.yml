Nikko and a 2 others did 'meet' me snout to hand through a fence -- others warned me to guard my camera lens (so their rough tongues don't destroy it), but I was too busy peeing my pants with delight to care and told them all so. Nikko is also the wolf featured on special Wisconsin license plates (to benefit the Endangered Resources Fund at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources). A bit of Nikko can be spotted, framed, in the Chief Joseph photo.</p>\n"

Complete with portly pig and prancing pup -- they are on the run! An estate find, this piece has a few paint flakes, a flea bite and a chip at the base (by the word 'Son') We've taken many close-up photos, so please look at them. In our opinion these do not detract from this rare bit of nursery rhyme history, but rather add charm and authenticity to the piece. The winner will be proud to display this whimsical figurine. No marks for maker. Stands 6.25 inches tall. Base is 4 inches in diameter.</p>\n"

These lamps are primarily antique white (creme colored), with each lily having it's center painted a warm yellow. Oval bases are painted metalic gold, as are several accents on the lilies. These are not the cold representations of cala lilies done in the 80's -- these are warm &amp; feminine. They are finished, front &amp; back, so there is no 'bad side' to hide! Conditions: Use, vintage item, but no chips, cracks or repairs. One of the lamps has this spot, which is not a chip. It appears to be a manufacturing flaw, an extra drop of paint, &amp; we show it so you can see it. These are quite charming lamps, &amp; very unique. They would be wonderful in homes with romantic or shabby n chic decors -- they are feminine, but not overly frilly.</p>\n"

Marked The Sun Rubber Company, 1961, on both the back of the movable head and on the tummy. Though not marked with his name, this is Jolly Jumbo, #480. Jolly wears a hot pink circus-type headdress with details (lace or fine chain) in metallic paint, including along his forehead. Jolly is also roll-y -- he has wheels on the bottoms of his four feet. While Jolly Jumbo no longer squeaks (we can hear the squeaker rolling about inside), he rolls on his clear glass \"marble\" wheels just fine. A very unique and adorable find, that's for sure! Conditions: Minimal signs of wear; his colors are bright and cheery. Again, he doesn't squeak (don't know if you can repair that? We didn't want to decapitate him to find out, so we'll leave that for the collector who has a clue.) No damages to plastic or rubber. Really a spiffy elephant awaiting a collector to show him off as he deserves.</p>\n"

(It is held at the nape of the neck with a pin.) On the back of the neck this doll is marked EIH © 1911. After some thorough research, we believe this to be one of the Horsman Can't Break 'Em character dolls -- and also the first in the Gold Medal Baby series, its face having been created by Helen Fox Trowbridge. This head was sculpted in 1911 using her own one-year-old son, Mason Jr., as the model. This was the first time, the first in the series that Horsman called the Gold Medal Baby, that this mold was used. The doll measures 12 inches. We've taken lots of photos to show conditions, including the broken fingertips on the right hand, the wear on the left foot (likely from some child's sucking, and the wear on the head. All the joints are flexible and move nicely. Overall, we are impressed with this old fragile doll's beauty &amp; charm -- and we hope you are too because he needs a loving home!</p>\n"

    description: "<p>Harvey the Invisible Rabbit's Own Coloring Book, Authorized Edition, The Saalfield Publishing Company, Akron, Ohio, New York. A cute coloring book based upon the character from the Jimmy Stewart movie -- or, as printed on the title page: \"HARVEY is an invisible rabbit, but he can be seen in this book by all good children! HARVEY is 6 feet, 1 1/2 inches tall with his ears down! HARVEY has come straight from New York City where he is the leading character in the Pulitzer Prize Play written by Mary Chase. In that play he delights hundreds of thousands of people. Now he comes to delight children all over this land in this brand new coloring book!\" Measures 15 x 9 inches. Conditions: Cover wear, including tears, mostly on back cover, please view photos. Most pages are colored. Staple bound, but not all pages are secure. No credits for artist; no year or copyright listed. The cover has a '3' printed on it, lower left -- where the tear is, so the number likely is not complete. Based on the text quoted above, this seems to predate the film. Please, contact us with questions!</p>\n"
