    description: "<p> </p>\n\n<p>well i have bad acne too. to get rid of it like bit more fast than usually you go to the doctor and tell them about your acne (don't worry about showing them your acne they seen worst) and they write a prescription for you for \"Clindoxyl Gel\" it works really well you wash your face and apply it then the next day it shrinks down really fast. (P.S don't eat alot of junk food it makes alot of pimples on your face and you will only wonder how to get rid of acne</a>) and using a soap bar makes it really worst.</p>\n\n<p>Ok well a couple of things,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You should not just be washing your face with soap. There is a reason why they make face washes. The science behind it is, most washes and soaps are not pH balanced. Our skin has a thing called an \"acid mantle.\" Which is around a pH of 4.5.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When you wash with a high alkaline soap, you raise your skins pH that results in dryness. and can evn result in lizard skin.</p>\n\n<p>this happens because the high pH sends the enzmyes in our skin that are responsible for natural exfoliation into hyperdrive.</p>\n\n<p>I would strongly suggest you go to the drug store and buy a cheap wash. IF you can i would even higher recommend you buy a nicer face wash that is pH balanced like Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel.</p>\n\n<p>But since you have acne, you are best off getting an acne wash. They make an acne wash too, but acne washes can not be perfectly balanced for our skin, or else they would not be able to kill the bacteria.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Never use toothpaste as a spot treatment. The fluoride in toothpaste is known to burn the skin. Instead invest in a nice spot treatment for your breakouts.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you wear a helmet, wipe down the straps and pads in the helmet with an alcohol pad. If you wear a backpack, get an acne face wipe, and wipe down your back after your bike. The increase sweat causes an increase of bacteria.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An acne face wipe can also help keep your face free of breakouts, or at least be used to spruce up before and after work.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n"
