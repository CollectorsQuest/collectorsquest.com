    description: "<p> </p>\n\n<p>well i have bad acne too. to get rid of it like bit more fast than usually you go to the doctor and tell them about your acne (don't worry about showing them your acne they seen worst) and they write a prescription for you for \"Clindoxyl Gel\" it works really well you wash your face and apply it then the next day it shrinks down really fast. (P.S don't eat alot of junk food it makes alot of pimples on your face and you will only wonder how to get rid of acne</a>) and using a soap bar makes it really worst.</p>\n\n<p>Ok well a couple of things,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You should not just be washing your face with soap. There is a reason why they make face washes. The science behind it is, most washes and soaps are not pH balanced. Our skin has a thing called an \"acid mantle.\" Which is around a pH of 4.5.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When you wash with a high alkaline soap, you raise your skins pH that results in dryness. and can evn result in lizard skin.</p>\n\n<p>this happens because the high pH sends the enzmyes in our skin that are responsible for natural exfoliation into hyperdrive.</p>\n\n<p>I would strongly suggest you go to the drug store and buy a cheap wash. IF you can i would even higher recommend you buy a nicer face wash that is pH balanced like Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel.</p>\n\n<p>But since you have acne, you are best off getting an acne wash. They make an acne wash too, but acne washes can not be perfectly balanced for our skin, or else they would not be able to kill the bacteria.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Never use toothpaste as a spot treatment. The fluoride in toothpaste is known to burn the skin. Instead invest in a nice spot treatment for your breakouts.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you wear a helmet, wipe down the straps and pads in the helmet with an alcohol pad. If you wear a backpack, get an acne face wipe, and wipe down your back after your bike. The increase sweat causes an increase of bacteria.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An acne face wipe can also help keep your face free of breakouts, or at least be used to spruce up before and after work.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n"

All in all they made 188 ads.<br /><br />I bought a lot of about 340 National Geographic magazines for $30 and received about 100 Coca-Cola ads. I have them in acid free page protectors in binders.<br /><span><br />A post from Phil Mooney on Coca-Cola Conversations says that individual ads are worth between $2-$5. If these prices are still current, I have about $200-$500 worth of National Geographic Coca-Cola ads.</span>'

The only book missing is edition number 38 to make the entire collection complete. This is a rare opportunity to have an entire collection.\r\n\r\nAll the books in pretty fair condition with no pages missing or torn. These were my own books as a child and were precious to me. Of course they show wear. They all have their pretty cover jackets. Tweed covers under the jackets. Copyright dates inside from1947 to 1952. Smoke free home.\r\n\r\nPrice includes the entire set of 44 books or less than $5.50 a book. A real bargain since their value is $10 or more a book and priceless as a collection.\r\n"

    description: 'Ever since I was a kid, I have loved DC Comics. The year they came out with the Pepsi Promo glasses, I was excited. My first was Wonder Woman and then Superman. Over the years, I have collected these glasses and as far as I know, I have the largest collection I have seen online.&nbsp;<br /><br />Collection Includes:<br /><br />Supergirl (NP)<br />Shazam<br />Shazam&nbsp;(NP)<br />Flash<br />Aquaman&nbsp;<br />Aquaman&nbsp;(NP)<br />Green Arrow&nbsp;(NP)<br />Superman<br />Superman&nbsp;(NP)<br />Wonder Woman<br />Wonder Woman&nbsp;(NP)<br />Batgirl&nbsp;(NP)<br />Green Lantern&nbsp;(NP)<br />Batman<br />Robbin<br />Penguin&nbsp;(NP)<br />Joker&nbsp;(NP)<br />Riddler&nbsp;(NP)<br />Robin&nbsp;(NP)<br />Batman&nbsp;(NP)<br /><br />I would consider selling the glasses (I also have duplicates) along with the shelving if the price was right. They are all in great condition!&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope to have better pictures soon.&nbsp;'

    description: "This Williams' machine from 1979 is pretty awesome! I obtained this from a local collector, and after months of tinkering, I just couldn't get the sound to work. This version does NOT have the unique banana flippers, but traditional straight flippers instead. I bought this because the price was right and the graphics were incredible. All of the body graphics are still intact. I love this machine, and the time travel theme (dinosaurs, astronauts, cavemen, knights, egyptians, and a ton of other awesome details), but I'm out of space!\n\nMachine is in good condition. While the sound doesn't work, everything else functions excellently & turns on with no problem. Internal plastics look fine (awesome Egyptian bumpers!), though there's a possibility that I could have missed something, as I'm a relative amateur. Known flaws include :\n\n- Like most older machines, it needs to be cleaned inside and out.- Backglass isn't perfect. Has scraping / peeling areas around edges, but it doesn't really interfere with the graphics.- Wooden body has gouges, and two large holes drilled in the front (originally, to lock the coin box down).\n\nSo, it's time to part ways with this machine. Only 8.875 units were ever made, and it comes with a very high rating from the International Pinball database!\n\nBecause of the size of the machine, it's local pickup ONLY, and I'm located within the Hudson Valley. You supply the tools (unbolt the legs & upper portion), and I'll help you get it to the truck!\n\nMore pics available upon request!\n\nhttp://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=2568"

    description: "\r\n\r\nThoth Tarot - White Box A\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span>\r\nTwo piece box with a white cover and gold insert box with two notches. \r\nText is printed in black ink. Side of the box reads \"Thoth Tarot Cards \r\nby Aleister Crowley. Distributed by Samuel Weiser, 734 Broadway, N.Y. \r\n10003. Printed in U.S.A.\" The back of the box has the borderless rose \r\ncross artwork. There is no date printed on the box, but this version of \r\nthe deck has been dated 1969. For its age, the box is in beautiful \r\ncondition with very little wear or staining.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThis is a full deck of 78 cards plus one OTO card. The cards themselves \r\nhave the \"muddy\" artwork typical of this edition of the deck. The cards \r\nhave the undecorated light powder blue border on the front. You can see \r\nin the pictures that the blue color varies from card to card - some \r\nborders are very obviously blue while some are almost white. This \r\nvariation is typical of this edition. The card suits are printed on the \r\nbottom of the card with the card name super-imposed over the top.  The \r\nbacks of the cards feature borderless rose cross artwork. These cards do\r\n not have the greenish cast to the artwork typical of later editions of \r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThese cards were given to me by an older woman who says she practiced \r\nwith them while she was younger, but has since given up \"reading \r\npeople's fortunes.\" She said she learned the art from her mother, a \r\ntradition which might have been in this woman's family for generations. \r\nAs such, the cards all feature handwriting in the upper right and left \r\nhand corners. Each card has its number within the deck, its number \r\nwithin the suit, its related astrological sign plus its decan within \r\nthat sign written on it in ball point pen. Interesting information that \r\nmight increase or decrease the value of the cards depending on the \r\nperson bidding.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe actual physical condition of the cards is very good. They appear to \r\nhave been used rarely if at all. There is no creasing on any of the \r\ncards. There are also no printing defects (for example, the eight of \r\ncups does indeed have an \"8\" at the top of the card.) The box is also in\r\n very good condition. If you would like any additional photos of the box\r\n or deck, please feel free to contact me. At this time I am not offering\r\n international shipping, but if you like, you can message me and perhaps\r\n we can work something out if you would like it shipped to somewhere \r\nother than the United States.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nI hope these cards will find their way to someone who can carry on the tradition of \"reading people's fortunes.\" Good luck!<br /></span><br />"
