    body: 'Yes, although one generation removed from the actual originals. A paleontologist friend found the original models in storage at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and pulled molds from them. My models are from those molds, which could only survive one pull each. Then new molds were generated from my molds -- and pulls from them are the ones being sold by Mary Odano''s company, Valley Anatomical Preparations in Canoga Park, CA.'

    body: 'Unfortunately, the only one I know of is the one on my shelf. There were plenty of them for sale (I believe for around $.59) at the gift shop when I got this one in 1955. I also have a nice black & white postcard from Rapid City''s Dinosaur Park showing a painted version of this model. By the way, this model was sold as a kind of preview to the life-sized Protoceratops which was still being made when I first visited Dinosaur Park. The model was sculpted by Emmett A. Sullivan, who also made all the full-size figures for the park.'

Then again, I probably wouldn't sell it because it charms me so!) \r\n\r\nIf you found a Kate Smith fan or Swans Down collector who just had to have it, you might get a bit more out of that strong impulse buy...

I have that booklet also (Candy and How!) and my last name is Cummings as well :-) I have such fond memories of making the Vinegar Taffy, Panocha, and Divinity recipes from this booklet, and still make them today.

    body: 'Foundation recipes are like basic recipes -- the foundation for several other recipes. For soups, it would be like a basic chicken broth, a basic creme soup ''stock'', etc. For cakes and baking, it is the basic recipes from which you build to make the cakes, frostings, etc. So you''d make a specific cake, beginning with one of the "foundation" recipes.  Does that make sense?'

After he returned to work, Baby Blue Eyes could not be found. One day he cane home with the Tod-L-Tim doll. I fell in love with that doll and carried it everywhere with me.

In the 1950s, her comic skills were showcased in movies such as How to Marry a Millionaire and Designing Woman.\r\n\r\nBacall has continued to have a successful acting career for many decades. She was nominated for a Golden Globe and Academy Award for her performance in 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces.\r\n\r\nThis autographed photo by Bacall measures 10x8. The photograph shows Bacall in an elegant profile pose, wearing a white shirt and pearl earrings.\r\n\r\nWritten in blue ink, the signature and photograph are in fine condition.\r\n\r\nMessage us for more photographs.

    body: "I visited the museum and grounds many times during the '50's\r\nand have two of these bronze figurines - a Dire Wolf ( sadly with one missing hind leg - broken sometime over the intervening years and several relocations ) and an intact casting of a Mammoth. Both are now highly prised and sit in a prominent\r\nplace in a showcase. I also have an almost new copy of the \r\nField Manual for La Brea with pictures and commentary.\r\nI went back to visit the Museum two years ago and was surprised at how the Tar Pits had changed over the years. As I\r\nrecall, there were three separate pools in the fifties, now there is but one very large one. An interesting place to visit even today."

    body: 'You are absolutely correct. There are some pics of Edaphosauruses, and we all remember times when Dimetrodons used to eat them for early breakfast and late dinners before and after burning sun lights.
