    body: 'Yes, although one generation removed from the actual originals. A paleontologist friend found the original models in storage at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and pulled molds from them. My models are from those molds, which could only survive one pull each. Then new molds were generated from my molds -- and pulls from them are the ones being sold by Mary Odano''s company, Valley Anatomical Preparations in Canoga Park, CA.'

    body: 'Unfortunately, the only one I know of is the one on my shelf. There were plenty of them for sale (I believe for around $.59) at the gift shop when I got this one in 1955. I also have a nice black & white postcard from Rapid City''s Dinosaur Park showing a painted version of this model. By the way, this model was sold as a kind of preview to the life-sized Protoceratops which was still being made when I first visited Dinosaur Park. The model was sculpted by Emmett A. Sullivan, who also made all the full-size figures for the park.'

    body: "Hi Irene,\r\n\r\nMost ephemera is, in the words of big collectors, auctioneers, etc., \"worthless\" unless it's related to or signed by an historical figure, celebrity, etc.  That said, the cookbook fetches from $5 to $15, depending upon conditions etc.  (I wouldn't take less than $15 for this one; it's in lovely shape.  Then again, I probably wouldn't sell it because it charms me so!) \r\n\r\nIf you found a Kate Smith fan or Swans Down collector who just had to have it, you might get a bit more out of that strong impulse buy...

I have that booklet also (Candy and How!) and my last name is Cummings as well :-) I have such fond memories of making the Vinegar Taffy, Panocha, and Divinity recipes from this booklet, and still make them today. My copy has pieces of ancient cellophane tape holding it together and is stained, but I still use it :-)'

    body: 'Foundation recipes are like basic recipes -- the foundation for several other recipes. For soups, it would be like a basic chicken broth, a basic creme soup ''stock'', etc. For cakes and baking, it is the basic recipes from which you build to make the cakes, frostings, etc. So you''d make a specific cake, beginning with one of the "foundation" recipes.

    body: 'I used to have all of these when I was a kid. It''s a shame I never kept them. The triceratops was done in a brown plastic, much as yours is. The others came in a sort of iridescent purple/brown colour. I do have the monogram re-release of the stegosaur under the Jurassic park label and wish I could get hold of them again (alas: not much chance of that).'

My Mom told me it was won by my G'pa at a carnival sometime in the 1930's, and given to my G'ma. From what you know about this one - could that be possible? Also, I am think of writing a nostalgia piece about it and wonder if I could use this photograph for the article? If I can, can you advise how you would want to be credited?\r\nThanks so much. "

After he returned to work, Baby Blue Eyes could not be found. One day he cane home with the Tod-L-Tim doll. I fell in love with that doll and carried it everywhere with me. I grew up, and have no idea what ever happened to the doll but I will never forget it.  '

    body: "SAMPLE OCR FROM Viewmaster BOOKLET\r\n-------------------3. Alice followed the White Rabbit around the corner of a\r\nlong passage, but it was gone and she was in a long hall with\r\nlocked doors all around. On a little table she found a tiny\r\ngolden key that fitted a door fifteen inches high; she opened\r\nit and looked into a beautiful garden, but could not even get\r\nher head through the doorway.\r\n\r\nFinding a little bottle labeled \"DRINK ME,\" Alice did so.\r\nImmediately, she shut up like a telescope. Joyfully, she hur-\r\nried to the door, but found she had forgotten the key. She\r\ntired herself out trying to climb the table legs, and then she\r\nsat down and cried.------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n4. Finally Alice stopped crying, and spied a little glass box\r\nunder the table containing a cake labeled \"EAT ME.\" \"Cur-\r\niouser and curiouser!\" she cried, for now she was opening\r\nup like the largest telescope ever. Happily she grabbed up\r\nthe key and went back to the door. Poor Alice! It was all she\r\ncould do to see into the garden with one eye.\r\n\r\nJust then the White Rabbit returned carrying a pair of\r\nwhite gloves and a large fan. When Alice spoke to it the\r\nRabbit dropped its things and scurried away. Alice picked\r\nup the gloves and fan and started fanning herself. She began\r\nshrinking rapidly and stopped fanning just in time to keep\r\nfrom shrinking away altogether.-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n5. Alice started after the Rabbit. Soon she met it trotting\r\ntowards her, looking about it as it went.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbit saw her and said angrily, \"Why, Mary Ann,\r\nwhat are you doing here? Run home and fetch me a pair of\r\ngloves and a fan.\" Alice was so frightened she ran off and\r\nsoon came upon the Rabbit's house.\r\n\r\nIn an upstairs room she found two or three pairs of white\r\ngloves, a fan, and a little bottle. It had no label, but she\r\nbegan to drink it. She began to grow larger! She dropped\r\nthe bottle, but kept on growing. Soon she had to put one\r\narm out the window and one foot up the chimney.-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n6. The Rabbit came and tried to open the door, but Alice's\r\nelbow was against it, and she heard it say to itself, \"I'll go\r\naround and get in the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you won't,\" thought Alice. She spread out her hand\r\nand made a snatch in the air- She didn't catch anything but\r\nthere was a shriek and a fall, and a sound of broken glass as if\r\nsomeone had fallen into a cucumber frame. Then it was quiet.-----------------------------------------\r\n7. A little later came the sound of many voices. The Rabbit\r\nordered an animal named Bill to go down the chimney. Alice\r\ndrew her foot as far down as it would go and waited until\r\nshe heard Bill Just above it, then gave a good kick.\r\n\r\n\"Catch Bill, you by the hedge,\" she heard the Rabbit shout.\r\n\"Hold his head up, there—given him brandy!\"\r\n\r\nNext a shower of little pebbles rattled in the window.\r\n\r\nWhen they turned into cakes, she swallowed one. Alice began\r\nshrinking rapidly. She ran out of the house only to be chased\r\nby the crowd of animals outside, but she ran as hard as she\r\ncould and was safe in a thick wood.-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTHE MAD TEA PARTY in 3d viewmaster format----------------------\r\n\r\nView-Master Reef Two-----------------------\r\n\r\n1. As Alice rested, she noticed a large mushroom and\r\nstretched herself on tiptoe to peep over the edge. Her eyes\r\nmet those of a large blue caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Caterpillar in a sleepy voice.\r\n\"I hardly know, sir,\" Alice said shyly. \"I've been so many\r\nsizes today I'm all confused.\"\r\n\r\n\"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar.\r\n\"I'd like to be a little larger, sir,\" Alice said. \"Three inches\r\nis such a wretched height to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"it is a very good height indeed,\" said the Caterpillar\r\nangrily. (It was exactly three inches high.) It got down off\r\nthe mushroom and crawled away, saying as it went, \"One\r\nside of the mushroom will make you grow taller, and the other\r\nside will make you grow shorter.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n2. Alice broke off a piece of mushroom in each hand, and\r\nby carefully nibbling first one bit and then the other, and\r\ngrowing first shorter and then taller, regained her usual\r\n\r\nheight. She started again for the garden, but came to a\r\n\r\nsmall house about four feet high.\r\n\r\n\"It will never do to come upon them this size,\" she said,\r\nand by nibbling the mushroom shrank to nine inches.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------3. Alice entered the kitchen where a Duchess was nursing\r\na baby and the cook stirred a cauldron of soup. The air was\r\nso full of pepper that only the cook and a large cat which\r\nsat grinning from ear to ear, were not sneezing.\r\n\r\n\"Please tell me,\" said Alice, \"Why your cat grins so?\"\r\n\"It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess. \"That's why.\"\r\nAs she spoke the cook began throwing everything within\r\nreach at her. She ignored it, and the baby was already\r\nhowling so it was impossible to tell if it were being hurt. The\r\nDuchess flung the baby to Alice to hold while she got ready\r\nto play croquet with the Queen.------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n4. Alice took the baby outside, where it turned into \"a pig\r\nand trotted away. She saw the Cheshire Cat sitting in a tree,\r\nand asked it for directions.\r\n\r\n\"In thai direction,\" said the Cat, waving one paw, \"lives\r\na Hatter; and in that direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives\r\na March Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not want to go among mad people, but the Cat\r\nassured Alice that \"everyone here is mad. I'm mad.\" He\r\nexplained, \"You grant that a dog's not mad. Well, a dog ETC\r\n"

When GSP did this he had the sauropods as Brachiosaurus but of course they are different (what he later renamed Giraffatitan). The barosaurs... turns out they are genus Tornieria. With some generalized pterodactyloids and ceratosaurids on the bottom. Since you have this piece, the likelihood of him updating this painting now is nil...'

    body: 'Hello Boki. I am glad to hear from you. I have seen your pictures of antelopes. This (and some other my collections) started from your pictures. Great herd you got there as well as rest of your collections. I do use it a lot as a reference and guide as probably many other collectors. Thank you for sharing.'

My dad removed the casters \r\n\r\nbecause when you removed his head you could stick in\r\n\r\nyour hand an feel the sharp nail-like spears of the \r\n\r\ncasters; he saw me through many a hard-time growing \r\n\r\nup.....absolutely my favorite toy and buddy on rainy\r\n\r\nlonely days.  By the by, the tapestry on his head and\r\n\r\nhis eyes came painted in a variety of many colors."

In the 1950s, her comic skills were showcased in movies such as How to Marry a Millionaire and Designing Woman.\r\n\r\nBacall has continued to have a successful acting career for many decades. She was nominated for a Golden Globe and Academy Award for her performance in 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces.\r\n\r\nThis autographed photo by Bacall measures 10x8. The photograph shows Bacall in an elegant profile pose, wearing a white shirt and pearl earrings.\r\n\r\nWritten in blue ink, the signature and photograph are in fine condition.\r\n\r\nMessage us for more photographs.

    body: "I visited the museum and grounds many times during the '50's\r\nand have two of these bronze figurines - a Dire Wolf ( sadly with one missing hind leg - broken sometime over the intervening years and several relocations ) and an intact casting of a Mammoth. Both are now highly prised and sit in a prominent\r\nplace in a showcase. I also have an almost new copy of the \r\nField Manual for La Brea with pictures and commentary.\r\nI went back to visit the Museum two years ago and was surprised at how the Tar Pits had changed over the years. As I\r\nrecall, there were three separate pools in the fifties, now there is but one very large one. An interesting place to visit even today."

There are some pics of Edaphosauruses, and we all remember times when Dimetrodons used to eat them for early breakfast and late dinners before and after burning sun lights.

It may be a little hard to find because it came out in 2007. Pricehot may get more in stock....maybe write them and ask if they will restock it. The company that makes the duck is called "Fuz Ducks."

    body: "Hi Hon. Sonam\r\n\r\nThanks for writing to me, and congratulations to the wedding of King Jigme's wedding of Bhutan in October. I am a Snowglobe collector, and the snow globes that you see in my collections are collected from different countries that I have visited and I don't make them. I believe you are looking for tailor made snow globes for this wedding right? There are Snowglobe manufacturers in china that design and produce them. If you are interested, I can help you source some manufacturers. Please kindly give me your email and I can send you the details. You can reach me at 86 1368 188 3660 or email me at wendywysuen@hotmail.com. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nWendy Suen "

It''s just for sentimental reasons...I owned one since I was born but in recent years the rubber melted and began to fall apart, so someone threw it out.  Sure would love a replacement!'

    body: "Maggie, if you go to Duckplanet.com you will see people of all ages collect ducks. It is a website for people who collect ducks. Everyone pretty much collects something....shoes, stamps, music, snowglobes, etc. Why not ducks? After all, there are some that are highly collectable and worth lots of money...like the old vintage ducks. Also check out this video of the world record holder of rubber duck collectors:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqUYCB4Pjj8\r\n\r\nPretty cool, huh?"

"It''s my biggest habit to try new design! and success or not is not important, I just enjoy the fun of it." Louboutin says the key to his success in designing shoes is that to combine the comfortable shoebody plus the sexy shape with each other perfectly,"Much of my inspiration originates from the feelings of my life; I am not applied towards the fast pace of urban life,For those who slow down your pace, life will take you by surprise."'

    body: 'I make mascots. Mascot-making is more busnseis-like than fursuiting. It''s based on the price range﻿ of the company. This costume is very basic and is the bare minimum of likeness to that design. These people got what they were willing to pay for. More often than not, people that make mascots use more creative range than people who make fursuits because fursuits almost always have the same shape and look. You can''t see costumes like Barney and Disney and say that fursuits are always better.'

    body: 'Here are some useful tips in ciosohng a name for your cat.- Please remember that the pet-name you choose will used dozens of times a day to call, praise and perhaps scold.- Pick a name that the pet can easily recognize. Animals respond better to one or two syllable names.- Choose a name thate28099s both easy to call out and one that you are happy calling out.- If ciosohng a long name keep in mind the shortened version. A long name will inevitably be shortened, but it may ruin the effect that you were originally looking for.- The pete28099s breed heritage can provide some useful inspiration. For example: Siamese, Balinese, Korat, and Burmese are Oriental breeds; Don Sphynx and Peterbald are Russian; Abyssinian is Egyptian; Chartreux is French; Bombay are British; Devon Rex is English.- Waiting a few days to study your pets behavior can help pick the right name. The Personality and Appearance categories may assist here.- Pick a name that will grow with the pet. For example "Kitten" may be less appropriate for a full grown cat. In my opinion, it''s more meaningful when you name your pet yourself. Check out these websites for tons of pet name ideas  you can search by breed, gender, color, meaning, and first letter of the name.'

    body: 'Why did He associate with such ppleoe?  He was not approving of their lives and choices   He was giving Himself to them.  He was extending His life toward them, as they were shunned by the religious hypocrites of the day.  The ppleoe Israel were supposed to be a light to the Gentiles, but instead, over time, began to consider Gentiles and sinners as  unclean , and therefore would not even associate with them.  Jesus not only associated with these  unclean  folks, but was a friend to them.As for sin not being allowed in the presence of God, I believe that has to do with the direct Presence of God in His glory in Heaven.'

This is becoming a very rich stew!Barry, SOOO nice to see you here! We spent some time talking about acronyms in the prior post, and as your note suggests, felt the word was more important than the eventual meaning placed on it (the changing face of the letters in SEED). Your note confirmed that, and I smiled as i read it.Jenny, Mike, Christina, Nancy   I love the words and images. Loving the thought of a  sound  word like  popping.  And more and more, the thought that it wouldn''t sound like an organization is interesting   the Kiva example per Romi and Jane.  And Laura, the  ize  grabbed me the minute you said it. Jane, I, too keep coming back to some themes like  potential  as well.  One I return to again and again is one that Mark Riffey noted here from the prior post, and one to which I have had several queries off-line:  Why not just call it Creating the Future, because that''s what you''re doing.   PotentializeCreating the Future of Our WorldOr is there a word that comes close to that in another language?Boy it feels like we''re getting close.HG'
