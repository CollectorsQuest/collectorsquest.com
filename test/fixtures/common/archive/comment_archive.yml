    body: 'Yes, although one generation removed from the actual originals. A paleontologist friend found the original models in storage at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and pulled molds from them. My models are from those molds, which could only survive one pull each. Then new molds were generated from my molds -- and pulls from them are the ones being sold by Mary Odano''s company, Valley Anatomical Preparations in Canoga Park, CA.'

    body: 'Unfortunately, the only one I know of is the one on my shelf. There were plenty of them for sale (I believe for around $.59) at the gift shop when I got this one in 1955. I also have a nice black & white postcard from Rapid City''s Dinosaur Park showing a painted version of this model. By the way, this model was sold as a kind of preview to the life-sized Protoceratops which was still being made when I first visited Dinosaur Park. The model was sculpted by Emmett A. Sullivan, who also made all the full-size figures for the park.'

With some generalized pterodactyloids and ceratosaurids on the bottom. Since you have this piece, the likelihood of him updating this painting now is nil...'

Great herd you got there as well as rest of your collections. I do use it a lot as a reference and guide as probably many other collectors. Thank you for sharing.'

In the 1950s, her comic skills were showcased in movies such as How to Marry a Millionaire and Designing Woman.\r\n\r\nBacall has continued to have a successful acting career for many decades. She was nominated for a Golden Globe and Academy Award for her performance in 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces.\r\n\r\nThis autographed photo by Bacall measures 10x8.

Both are now highly prised and sit in a prominent\r\nplace in a showcase. I also have an almost new copy of the \r\nField Manual for La Brea with pictures and commentary.\r\nI went back to visit the Museum two years ago and was surprised at how the Tar Pits had changed over the years. As I\r\nrecall, there were three separate pools in the fifties, now there is but one very large one. An interesting place to visit even today."
