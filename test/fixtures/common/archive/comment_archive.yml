    body: 'Yes, although one generation removed from the actual originals. A paleontologist friend found the original models in storage at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and pulled molds from them. My models are from those molds, which could only survive one pull each. Then new molds were generated from my molds -- and pulls from them are the ones being sold by Mary Odano''s company, Valley Anatomical Preparations in Canoga Park, CA.'

    body: 'Unfortunately, the only one I know of is the one on my shelf. There were plenty of them for sale (I believe for around $.59) at the gift shop when I got this one in 1955. I also have a nice black & white postcard from Rapid City''s Dinosaur Park showing a painted version of this model. By the way, this model was sold as a kind of preview to the life-sized Protoceratops which was still being made when I first visited Dinosaur Park. The model was sculpted by Emmett A. Sullivan, who also made all the full-size figures for the park.'

I''ve been lately researching about the show and I found William Stout was involved in it, also. What did he actually did, did he draw or designed the dinos and weaponry, or something?'

    body: "Hi Irene,\r\n\r\nMost ephemera is, in the words of big collectors, auctioneers, etc., \"worthless\" unless it's related to or signed by an historical figure, celebrity, etc.  That said, the cookbook fetches from $5 to $15, depending upon conditions etc.  (I wouldn't take less than $15 for this one; it's in lovely shape.  Then again, I probably wouldn't sell it because it charms me so!) \r\n\r\nIf you found a Kate Smith fan or Swans Down collector who just had to have it, you might get a bit more out of that strong impulse buy...

    body: 'Foundation recipes are like basic recipes -- the foundation for several other recipes. For soups, it would be like a basic chicken broth, a basic creme soup ''stock'', etc. For cakes and baking, it is the basic recipes from which you build to make the cakes, frostings, etc. So you''d make a specific cake, beginning with one of the "foundation" recipes.  Does that make sense?'

    body: "This beautiful chalkware collie is the closest I have seen to one that used to be in my possession during the 1950's and 1960's. My Mom told me it was won by my G'pa at a carnival sometime in the 1930's, and given to my G'ma. From what you know about this one - could that be possible? Also, I am think of writing a nostalgia piece about it and wonder if I could use this photograph for the article? If I can, can you advise how you would want to be credited?\r\nThanks so much. "

    body: 'These are created by different artists including paleoartist Shane Foulkes and many more. Dinostoreus Company supposedly has their own stile and that is creating some problem with creation of models because all artists have their own unique and individual artistic stile. At my knowledge company always looking for artists who can create new models with conformity to DinoStoreus models style. Models, wooden bases and all metal parts produced, painted and finished in China and shipped to US for sale.'

I can''t remember what year it was, late 40''s early 50''s, I asked my father for Baby Blue Eyes, a doll that was advertised on radio. at that time my father wasn''t working and couldn''t afford to get me the doll. he promised that when he went back to work, he would buy me that doll. After he returned to work, Baby Blue Eyes could not be found. One day he cane home with the Tod-L-Tim doll. I fell in love with that doll and carried it everywhere with me. I grew up, and have no idea what ever happened to the doll but I will never forget it.  '

I don't know about anyone else, but I think you have also beat Raquel Welsh of \"One Million Years B.C.\" \r\n     Could I ask you what are your measurements? You appear to be well endowed!

In the 1950s, her comic skills were showcased in movies such as How to Marry a Millionaire and Designing Woman.\r\n\r\nBacall has continued to have a successful acting career for many decades. She was nominated for a Golden Globe and Academy Award for her performance in 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces.\r\n\r\nThis autographed photo by Bacall measures 10x8. The photograph shows Bacall in an elegant profile pose, wearing a white shirt and pearl earrings.\r\n\r\nWritten in blue ink, the signature and photograph are in fine condition.\r\n\r\nMessage us for more photographs.

Both are now highly prised and sit in a prominent\r\nplace in a showcase. I also have an almost new copy of the \r\nField Manual for La Brea with pictures and commentary.\r\nI went back to visit the Museum two years ago and was surprised at how the Tar Pits had changed over the years. As I\r\nrecall, there were three separate pools in the fifties, now there is but one very large one. An interesting place to visit even today."

There are some pics of Edaphosauruses, and we all remember times when Dimetrodons used to eat them for early breakfast and late dinners before and after burning sun lights.

It may be a little hard to find because it came out in 2007. Pricehot may get more in stock....maybe write them and ask if they will restock it. The company that makes the duck is called "Fuz Ducks."

It''s just for sentimental reasons...I owned one since I was born but in recent years the rubber melted and began to fall apart, so someone threw it out.  Sure would love a replacement!'

Everyone pretty much collects something....shoes, stamps, music, snowglobes, etc. Why not ducks? After all, there are some that are highly collectable and worth lots of money...like the old vintage ducks. Also check out this video of the world record holder of rubber duck collectors:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqUYCB4Pjj8\r\n\r\nPretty cool, huh?"

    body: 'I make mascots. Mascot-making is more busnseis-like than fursuiting. It''s based on the price range﻿ of the company. This costume is very basic and is the bare minimum of likeness to that design. These people got what they were willing to pay for. More often than not, people that make mascots use more creative range than people who make fursuits because fursuits almost always have the same shape and look. You can''t see costumes like Barney and Disney and say that fursuits are always better.'

    body: 'Here are some useful tips in ciosohng a name for your cat.- Please remember that the pet-name you choose will used dozens of times a day to call, praise and perhaps scold.- Pick a name that the pet can easily recognize. Animals respond better to one or two syllable names.- Choose a name thate28099s both easy to call out and one that you are happy calling out.- If ciosohng a long name keep in mind the shortened version. A long name will inevitably be shortened, but it may ruin the effect that you were originally looking for.- The pete28099s breed heritage can provide some useful inspiration. For example: Siamese, Balinese, Korat, and Burmese are Oriental breeds; Don Sphynx and Peterbald are Russian; Abyssinian is Egyptian; Chartreux is French; Bombay are British; Devon Rex is English.- Waiting a few days to study your pets behavior can help pick the right name. The Personality and Appearance categories may assist here.- Pick a name that will grow with the pet. For example "Kitten" may be less appropriate for a full grown cat. In my opinion, it''s more meaningful when you name your pet yourself. Check out these websites for tons of pet name ideas  you can search by breed, gender, color, meaning, and first letter of the name.'

    body: 'Why did He associate with such ppleoe?  He was not approving of their lives and choices   He was giving Himself to them.  He was extending His life toward them, as they were shunned by the religious hypocrites of the day.  The ppleoe Israel were supposed to be a light to the Gentiles, but instead, over time, began to consider Gentiles and sinners as  unclean , and therefore would not even associate with them.  Jesus not only associated with these  unclean  folks, but was a friend to them.As for sin not being allowed in the presence of God, I believe that has to do with the direct Presence of God in His glory in Heaven.'

    body: 'you need to contact the ldernes and try to work something out with them.  tell them your situation and see if you can at least get the default knocked back a bit (as of now, you have a 90 day late on your report.  that is serious).  any delinquency is on your reports for 7.5 years, unless you can bargain with the lender to remove it.  once you do this actions speak louder than words.  you need to pay ontime, all of the time for the next couple of years.  if you do that, and keep your balances low your credit score will start to go back up again.  i would not apply for any car or home loans until you have gotten some of this sorted out if you can wait that long.'

I am afraid the potential for mis-spelling will make the URL confusing to remember, but I can''t shake the image.CoCreatr   welcome to the discussion and thanks for adding those other perspectives. This is becoming a very rich stew!Barry, SOOO nice to see you here! We spent some time talking about acronyms in the prior post, and as your note suggests, felt the word was more important than the eventual meaning placed on it (the changing face of the letters in SEED). Your note confirmed that, and I smiled as i read it.Jenny, Mike, Christina, Nancy   I love the words and images. Loving the thought of a  sound  word like  popping.  And more and more, the thought that it wouldn''t sound like an organization is interesting   the Kiva example per Romi and Jane.  And Laura, the  ize  grabbed me the minute you said it. Jane, I, too keep coming back to some themes like  potential  as well.  One I return to again and again is one that Mark Riffey noted here from the prior post, and one to which I have had several queries off-line:  Why not just call it Creating the Future, because that''s what you''re doing.   PotentializeCreating the Future of Our WorldOr is there a word that comes close to that in another language?Boy it feels like we''re getting close.HG'

If its credit card debt it is considered open line of credit ( i think) if somthing is in collections and you pay it off it should be removed farliy quick. You will have to ask that company to send you a letter that you payed off your debt.'
